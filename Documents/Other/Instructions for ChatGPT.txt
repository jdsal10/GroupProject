How to use the chatGPT Java class I wrote:

1. Create an executor service
2. Call executor.execute() with a lambda that calls ChatGPT_Client.chatGPT() with the input text
++ For safety and quality reasons, do the following after you are done with the output:
3. Call executor.shutdown()
4. Wait for the executor to finish

Example:
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    executor.execute(() -> {
        try {
            output.append(ChatGPT_Client.chatGPT("Hello"));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    });

    executor.shutdown();
    while (!executor.isTerminated()) {
        // Wait for the executor to finish
    }
