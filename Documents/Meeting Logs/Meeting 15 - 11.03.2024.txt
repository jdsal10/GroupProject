Q & A with Sergey

I (Nick) have heard that other groups (supervised by Kemi, for example) have finalized their projects and are now focused on submitting? 

Q: Just to confirm, we have to submit is the poster, abstract, actual app, technical report, contributions report, and a short video demoing the project. That's all, right?
A: Yes, that's all.

Q: How to submit the app? As far as I know, we should clone our repo to raptor. Do we zip it? Do we write instructions how to run it?
A: Clone the repo and zip it on raptor. Also submit an .apk file. Write a README with instructions how to use the app.

Q: Do you (Sergey) have any particular advise for any of the documents and files we must submit?
A: For the technical report - describe the overall architecture. Don't go in detail for individual functions. Must allow a person to start looking into conributing after reading the report. 
- In the report you can mention who is responsible for what, but don't go into details. This is for the individual report.
- The video is straight forward - a demo of how the app works.
- It is not necessary that everybody presents. 

Q: When would you advise us to stop working on issues?
A: Start writing the technical report now. Video can be done last minute.

Q: In appendix 4 of the guidance pdf on moodle it is said that we need to have a weekly_meetings.txt file with minutes from the weekly meetings.
    a) We never followed a particular structure when doing the weekly meetings, is that going to be an issue?
    b) We have a folder with txt files, is that ok, or do you suggest to merge them into a single txt file?
A: It is ok if.

Q: There is some index.html that we have to submit along with the corpus of materils. I looked at the example on moodle, but got confused. What is that supposed to be?
A: Like a site map, but for the project

Q: What is the viva voce (interview like???) examination going to be? Are you leading it and how to prepare for it?
A: Meet before the exam and discuss the proj. Work on a presentation to show all together. Prepare for general questions such as: What was easy? What was hard? What would do differently if you could start all over? Then we are going to be interviewed individually. Questinos about personal contribution are going to be asked.

* Write that we've prioritized smart features we've seen in other competitive apps (Nike Running, Nike workout app)
