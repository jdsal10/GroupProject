14/06/2023, 17:26 - You added Misha
14/06/2023, 22:46 - Misha: Hey guys, just wanted to know if we have a rough idea on the type of project we'll be doing? Just so I can research
15/06/2023, 01:46 - EthanT: I haven't got one as such yet, ive looked at the ones given on the forum, im up for any of them if you want one in particular
15/06/2023, 02:38 - Misha: Fairs, we can select a few and talk about them and whether everyone is good with at least 1
15/06/2023, 08:56 - +44 7856 791314: Hello, guys! Sorry for not checking the group yesterday, its been a few extremely busy days lately. I currently don't have idea what theme do choose for the project. I'll add Manu and Juan rn. Do you know if they'll be able to see past messages?
15/06/2023, 08:56 - +44 7856 791314 added Juan and Manuel Montero
15/06/2023, 08:57 - +44 7856 791314: Hey, guys @447753129330 @447452833836 ! Do you see the past messages (not that there are a lot of them).
15/06/2023, 10:40 - Juan: Hey Nikola, no I don't see anything
15/06/2023, 10:52 - Manuel Montero: I cannot see anything!

15/06/2023, 13:29 - EthanT: If people don't know one to create, have  a look at the list of potential options
15/06/2023, 13:29 - EthanT: https://forum.cs.kent.ac.uk/forumdisplay.php?122-COMP6000-Project-Proposals
15/06/2023, 19:04 - Juan: What do you guys think about choosing one of the app projects? Such as chat application or social activity app
15/06/2023, 19:07 - EthanT: Sounds good to me
15/06/2023, 19:14 - Manuel Montero: i like that idea
16/06/2023, 13:43 - EthanT: @447856791314  @447985120259 what do you think?
16/06/2023, 13:43 - +44 7856 791314: Hey hey
16/06/2023, 13:43 - +44 7856 791314: sorry for not being really active
16/06/2023, 13:44 - EthanT: No worries!
16/06/2023, 13:44 - +44 7856 791314: This idea sounds good
16/06/2023, 13:44 - +44 7856 791314: give me a minute to go over them though
16/06/2023, 13:48 - +44 7856 791314: The "Sports club booking app" looks like a good option as well
16/06/2023, 13:48 - EthanT: Looks like a good one to me
16/06/2023, 13:50 - +44 7856 791314: "Garage booking system" and "Shop management app" are also nice
16/06/2023, 13:50 - +44 7856 791314: lets make a spreadsheet btw
16/06/2023, 13:52 - +44 7856 791314: Also do you know if it matters who proposed the topic? I mean, if Yang He proposed the topic, can we ask Sergey to be our supervisor?
16/06/2023, 13:53 - EthanT: I think thats fine because hypothetically we could propose a project ourself, we cant be our own supervisor as such though.
16/06/2023, 13:55 - EthanT: I dont have a preference for our supervisor so if anyone wants a specific one, im cool with that
16/06/2023, 13:55 - +44 7856 791314: I like Sergey and Carlos the best
16/06/2023, 13:55 - Manuel Montero: I like Dan
16/06/2023, 13:55 - EthanT: Yh theyre good
16/06/2023, 13:59 - +44 7856 791314: I'll text Sergey just to see if he is available
16/06/2023, 14:12 - +44 7856 791314: The deadline is kinda approaching
16/06/2023, 14:12 - +44 7856 791314: it is 2 weeks from now
16/06/2023, 14:13 - Manuel Montero: That’s a good idea
16/06/2023, 14:21 - +44 7856 791314: He is in the list of available supervisiors, so, hopefully, he is available
16/06/2023, 15:42 - Misha: Sorry I'm not too active I'm on holiday atm so not on the phone much.
16/06/2023, 15:43 - Misha: I like the idea of an app
16/06/2023, 15:43 - Misha: Lots of potential
16/06/2023, 15:58 - +44 7856 791314: It is also the easiest, haha
16/06/2023, 15:58 - +44 7856 791314: I am willing to do something more interesting, even if it is harder though
16/06/2023, 15:59 - +44 7856 791314: However most of the other are kinda strange, idk
16/06/2023, 18:02 - EthanT: Are there any specific ones your interested in doing
17/06/2023, 10:50 - Misha: We can do something interesting and harder or we can create something more special inside the app up to you guys
17/06/2023, 11:45 - EthanT: Have a look if there's any specific ones you're interested in, I will as well later
18/06/2023, 13:55 - EthanT: Hi all, we have roughly 12 days until the registration deadline. Currently, we are looking at doing an app of some sort, such as "Sport booking app". @447856791314, you suggested about doing another project, potentially one more difficult. Are there any that you have noticed that look enticing.

Also we need to finalise who our supervisor will be. Currently, we have Carlos, vSergey and Dan. Are there any others people may want?
18/06/2023, 17:01 - Juan: I think that ideally we should have registered our project by next week. I like the idea of doing the "Sport booking app" or the "Social activity app", but I am also open to others that you propose.

It would be great if we choose a project within the next few days.
19/06/2023, 07:21 - +44 7856 791314: Not really
19/06/2023, 07:21 - +44 7856 791314: But I havent thought about them hard enough
19/06/2023, 07:21 - +44 7856 791314: Though the deadline is approaching and we have to be fast
19/06/2023, 07:22 - +44 7856 791314: Sergey replied to me with:

Hi Nikola,

Yes, I'm available for COMP6000 supervision.

Do you have a project idea already?

Sergey
19/06/2023, 07:23 - +44 7856 791314: Give me a few minutes and I will try and think of something interesting to do
19/06/2023, 07:26 - +44 7856 791314: guys...
19/06/2023, 07:28 - +44 7856 791314: I have an idea... and it is interesting... a bit challenging though, hear me out - Message Spam Filtering using a deep neural network to self-improve and get better in detecting spam. We will provide it with sample spam messages and then it will do its thing.

How does that sound to you?
19/06/2023, 07:37 - +44 7856 791314: Something else, that I find interesting:

15. Smart Farming Using IoT Technologies
Smart farming is a device built to detect the soil's temperature, moister, and humidity. 
This device will help the farmer to know the conditions of the soil. 
We need an Arduino Nano IDE, temperature and moisture sensors, and some jumper wires to build this device. 
This device will have a direct content with the soil, and the measurement is shown on the monitor screen.

This will require some investment in hardware though. If we find the hardware, though, I will be interested to invest real money into the project.
19/06/2023, 07:46 - +44 7856 791314: Some other interesting ideas:

- Sql Injection Prevention System
- ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES USING CHATGPT AND ITS API
19/06/2023, 07:47 - +44 7856 791314: If you all are ok with Sergey as our project supervisior, I can tell him all the ideas that are interesting to us and ask him to guide us in which direction to think in his opinion
19/06/2023, 10:42 - Misha: All of these topics will need lots of learning but I'll be very interested in the spam, SQL injection and chatgpt, I feel like for soil it's also interesting but it'll involve us spending extra
19/06/2023, 11:39 - +44 7856 791314: I see, maybe I got a bit too far with the soil one
19/06/2023, 11:39 - +44 7856 791314: I am happy that you like the other ones though. What about you, guys @447753129330 @447452833836 @447514583905 ?
19/06/2023, 11:41 - EthanT: Agree with this
19/06/2023, 12:30 - Misha: I would still be happy to do something like that, although the other topics have are the same difficulties and are also fun
19/06/2023, 12:54 - Juan: I also think that the spam filtering sounds very interesting
19/06/2023, 12:54 - Juan: And having Sergey as the project supervisor would be great

Final vote (single choice)
OPTION: Spam filter (1 vote)
OPTION: ChatGPT related (1 vote)

21/06/2023, 14:38 - Misha: With chatgpt, what will it be, an app where you can ask questions? Or something else? I'm not actually that sure what we can do haha
21/06/2023, 14:38 - Manuel Montero: Yeah I was thinking the same
21/06/2023, 14:39 - EthanT: Not entirely sure, Nik suggested it, so i added it to the list of potential project. Perhaps something like that yh
21/06/2023, 14:40 - Misha: Maybe we should find out what we can specifically do with gpt, as it's better to know now
21/06/2023, 14:41 - Misha: For example, maybe a pdf summariser that uses gpt to summarise
21/06/2023, 14:48 - EthanT: If we're too unsure on what to base the ChatGPT prroject on, it might be an idea to do the spam filter instead
21/06/2023, 14:50 - Misha: Yeah let's see what we can do for gpt
23/06/2023, 06:40 - +44 7856 791314: Good morning, guys
23/06/2023, 06:40 - +44 7856 791314: We are now waiting to see what Sergey might suggest
23/06/2023, 17:57 - +44 7856 791314: This is what I emailed Sergey, btw
23/06/2023, 17:57 - +44 7856 791314: Hello, Sergey,

Sorry for the delayed response. We have taken the time to discuss and consider various ideas for our final year project. After reviewing the suggestions provided in the forum, we have narrowed down our interests. We found the app-based ideas particularly appealing because of their relative simplicity in terms of software development. Apart from that, we thought that we may do something related to SQL injection detection and prevention, a spam filter based utilizing neural networks, and a project related to ChatGPT and its API.

While all ideas have their merits, we were most interested in the final idea. As avid users of ChatGPT, we have been impressed with its capabilities and find it inspiring. However, we are currently unsure about the specific direction we should take when utilizing ChatGPT's API and if we even should do that instead of the other ideas. Do you have any suggestions regarding any of the ideas and in which direction do you think we should focus? We all decided that we are going to listen to your advice and base our decision for the project on it.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Nikola (Manu, Misha, Juan, and Ethan)
23/06/2023, 18:04 - EthanT: Sounds perfect!
25/06/2023, 12:37 - EthanT: @447856791314 , any response back from Sergey.
If not, it may be best if we do Spam filter since that was next
25/06/2023, 13:57 - +44 7856 791314: No, not yet
25/06/2023, 13:57 - +44 7856 791314: I think he’ll reply tomorrow
25/06/2023, 13:57 - +44 7856 791314: Let’s wait for him
27/06/2023, 11:23 - EthanT: Have you had any reply yet, we have 3 days until the deadline for registration
27/06/2023, 11:33 - +44 7856 791314: No… not yet
27/06/2023, 11:33 - +44 7856 791314: I’ll double text him
27/06/2023, 11:33 - +44 7856 791314: Should we wait until tonight???
27/06/2023, 11:34 - EthanT: Yh
27/06/2023, 11:36 - +44 7856 791314: I sent him that

27/06/2023, 11:38 - EthanT: perfect
27/06/2023, 12:44 - +44 7856 791314: Do you know if there is any other channel through which we can get to Sergey?
27/06/2023, 13:06 - EthanT: Not sure, I'm walking my dogs rn, I'll email him too when I'm back
27/06/2023, 13:07 - Manuel Montero: I find it weird that the deadline is so soon we haven’t even received our results yet
28/06/2023, 07:24 - +44 7856 791314: GUYS GUYS GUY YA

28/06/2023, 12:05 - EthanT: Ok, so chatGPT seems to be good with Sergey. I dont know whether that counts as registration, ill look it up later todat
28/06/2023, 12:06 - EthanT: I think thats why people got their grades for some assignments bumped up, to almost guarantee their place in next year

28/06/2023, 18:08 - Misha: He mentioned that we can have a meeting, on teams possibly? Maybe we can ask for his advice there as well
28/06/2023, 18:10 - EthanT: Sounds good to me
28/06/2023, 18:13 - Misha: @447856791314 Would you mind emailing him asking for a meeting? We can even have this meeting after the deadline but I'm not sure
28/06/2023, 18:15 - Manuel Montero: I like this tbh
28/06/2023, 18:15 - Manuel Montero: I think we should ask him how to register the broad idea and then have successive meetings where we narrow it down?
28/06/2023, 18:16 - EthanT: I'll check the requirements for registration now
29/06/2023, 08:04 - +44 7856 791314: I emailed him this

02/07/2023, 07:50 - +44 7856 791314: When do you think we should arrange a meeting?
02/07/2023, 07:51 - +44 7856 791314: Maybe it is best to ask him when it will be the easiest for him and see if we are able to do it in that day
02/07/2023, 09:11 - Manuel Montero: Yeah I think that too
11/07/2023, 12:20 - EthanT: Hi all,
Its been just over a week since we registered and need to look at the next steps. We need to have a group meeting at some point to brainstorm some ideas. Im working near the end of July so realistically, we need to have the meeting at some point over this week or the next week. Is everyone freem at some point until then?
11/07/2023, 12:21 - EthanT: Also has anyone had any ideas on what we could base the project on?
11/07/2023, 12:23 - Misha: I'm free from the 13th-14th anytime
11/07/2023, 12:23 - +44 7856 791314: Let’s do it sometime next week then
11/07/2023, 12:24 - +44 7856 791314: I haven’t really spent a lot of time thinking about it, unfortunately
11/07/2023, 12:24 - +44 7856 791314: Sergey hasn’t said anything either
11/07/2023, 12:30 - Misha: I'm working everyday till the 21st I'll have to check what time I'm free
11/07/2023, 12:30 - Misha: Or you guys can have a meeting and send me the notes to also get my input
11/07/2023, 12:32 - Manuel Montero: I’m free 13th from like midday but after that I’m working until sunday all day
11/07/2023, 12:32 - EthanT: I have had one idea, unsure on how easy to implement it would be or whether it would be valid, but its basically an advanced health app with chatGPT implemented.

Im unsure about health app on IOS but on Samsung at least whilst its good at suggesting workouts and exercises, and has the capability to track the users progress, it still requires a lot of input from the user.

The new health app instead could be assisted by chatGPT that could assist the app with suggestions.

Some features:
- Ability to set custom alarms such as morning and evening (optional, depending on implementation may not be doable)
- Tailored meals that chatGPT  could generate, either from data the user provides initially, or the user can ask on the spot, like "evening meal that has high protein count that uses xyz ingredients"
- Custom workout routines that it can generate and add to the users schedule / calendar (I have used this before, seems to work pretty well)
- Motivational messages, or some form of encouragement to the users.

All of the above could be controlled by chatGPT, even through voice control.

Ultimately, its aiming at getting the user more involved with their health, whilst relieving some of the stress of deciding certain aspects like meals.
This is all ive gotten so far though.
12/07/2023, 14:54 - +44 7856 791314: I’ll check it out later
13/07/2023, 13:28 - EthanT: Also I'm only available for the call late weekdays and weekends
19/07/2023, 15:57 - EthanT: People available for the call soon?
19/07/2023, 16:06 - Misha: I’m only available at 10 or later
20/07/2023, 10:48 - EthanT: Have you read my suggestion for the project?
20/07/2023, 11:43 - Misha: I would like to do that very much
20/07/2023, 11:43 - Misha: It’ll be really interesting
20/07/2023, 14:07 - EthanT: @447753129330 @447856791314 thoughts on this
20/07/2023, 14:56 - Manuel Montero: I’m at work atm! But I’ll read it in detail when I go on my break
21/07/2023, 09:32 - EthanT: I can meet up up with him next week if no ones free
21/07/2023, 13:09 - Manuel Montero: I like this idea, the health app in iOS doesn’t really do fitness (it works alongside the fitness app, which works better if you have an Apple Watch) but I like this idea a lot
21/07/2023, 13:20 - EthanT: Yh, I've asked gpt a few times to suggest workouts and it seems to generate pretty good ones, so with more precise requests we should be able to generate a range of options
22/07/2023, 15:27 - +44 7856 791314: Hey, guys, sorry for being so inactive during the summer, my bad. I am going to read your suggestion rn.
22/07/2023, 15:35 - +44 7856 791314: Hey guys, I like the idea a lot. The only thing that concerns me is if it is allowed to give health advice. If someone wants to implement it for real, they would probably have to hire doctors to double check the information. If we do it with the presumption that this is just a beta and not a real app, then this might not be an issue, though.
22/07/2023, 15:36 - +44 7856 791314: If we all agree on this idea, I can text Sergey. He hasn’t replied to my last email yet, but it’s summer, I don’t blame him.
22/07/2023, 15:37 - +44 7856 791314: I just realized that both my first messages start with “Hey guys”.
22/07/2023, 15:38 - +44 7856 791314: Please confirm that everyone agrees with Ethan’s idea.
22/07/2023, 15:39 - Manuel Montero: I agree, I quite like the e-health orientation
22/07/2023, 16:18 - EthanT: The idea wasn't to give health advice initially, only workout and meal advice
22/07/2023, 17:27 - Misha: We can leave health advice if necessary and replace it with another interesting feature
25/07/2023, 08:08 - EthanT: Sounds good to me
26/07/2023, 10:57 - EthanT: POLL:
E-Health App?
OPTION: Yes (5 votes)
OPTION: No, something else (0 votes)

26/07/2023, 10:58 - +44 7856 791314: As far as I know, giving workout plans and meal advice is also illegal, if you don’t have the necessary qualifications.
26/07/2023, 11:00 - +44 7856 791314: However, as I mentioned earlier, this should be OK as long as we make it clear that this is a beta version. If someone ever decides to implement this for real, he/she would have to hire professionals that double check the AI’s advice.
26/07/2023, 11:01 - EthanT: I don't think its illegal, I can double check that tho. Plus, it's not demanding that you eat this, more of a suggestion. Same with the workout plans. After a workout is suggested, the assistant will ask if it should add it to your schedule
27/07/2023, 10:25 - EthanT: Have you message Sergey yet Nik
27/07/2023, 12:00 - EthanT: I can if you want
27/07/2023, 12:12 - +44 7856 791314: <Media omitted>
27/07/2023, 14:14 - EthanT: I'll start doing some research about the idea when I finish work
01/08/2023, 21:21 - Misha: Hopefully Sergey replies soon because we need to get all the technicality out of the way
01/08/2023, 21:21 - Misha: What language/framework we'll use
01/08/2023, 21:21 - Misha: As it might be something we'll have to learn from scratch
02/08/2023, 13:19 - EthanT: I've started looking at the api
02/08/2023, 13:20 - EthanT: I'll look at how it integrates within code later
03/08/2023, 08:45 - +44 7856 791314: Probably more than 1 language
03/08/2023, 10:02 - EthanT: We need to have a meeting soon so we can confirm somethings with the project
03/08/2023, 11:07 - Manuel Montero: definitely!
03/08/2023, 11:09 - EthanT: I've got a pretty good idea so far of how to implement the api, ill investigate after work
03/08/2023, 12:50 - Juan: When should we do it?
03/08/2023, 12:50 - Juan: I'm available next week
03/08/2023, 18:24 - EthanT: I'm avalibe in the afternoon / evening and weekends
03/08/2023, 22:46 - Juan: Should we try Wednesday evening?
04/08/2023, 06:38 - Manuel Montero: I definitely can do Wednesday
04/08/2023, 15:46 - Misha: I’m not sure about my availability yet but will let you guys know closer to the date
06/08/2023, 13:20 - EthanT: Wednesday is cool for me
08/08/2023, 10:19 - EthanT: If people are cool with doing the meeting tomorrow, I can message Sergey
08/08/2023, 12:18 - Misha: I might be unavailable until maybe late tomorrow like 9 but I’m able to do afternoon
08/08/2023, 12:28 - EthanT: I finish work at 5.30 but won't be back until 6.30
08/08/2023, 22:52 - Misha: I can make it 7 onwards now
09/08/2023, 08:32 - EthanT: I'll message Sergey later
09/08/2023, 18:36 - Juan: Are we all able to do the meeting today then?
09/08/2023, 18:36 - EthanT: Sergey hasn't messaged back
09/08/2023, 18:37 - Juan: Oh
09/08/2023, 18:37 - EthanT: I did ask him if the email when he's fre tho
09/08/2023, 18:37 - Juan: I think it would also be useful for us to talk about the project even if he isn't able
09/08/2023, 18:44 - EthanT: Pretty sure the plan was to meet with Sergey initially, I may not be home in time too
09/08/2023, 18:49 - Juan: Oh ok cool, I was just saying in case he is still on holidays
09/08/2023, 18:50 - Juan: Because if he is I don't think he will reply
14/08/2023, 18:45 - Misha: Could anyone send sergeys email here, I’ll also email him
14/08/2023, 18:50 - EthanT: I sent one to so358@kent.ac.uk which I think is his student, s.ovchinnik@kent.ac.uk is I think is his staff. His teams one is so362@kent.ac.uk

No idea which is his  active one though 🤣
14/08/2023, 19:56 - Misha: Gonna email all
17/08/2023, 18:53 - You added Nik
17/08/2023, 18:54 - Nik: Hey heya
17/08/2023, 18:54 - Nik: My phone broke and I had to give it for repair
17/08/2023, 18:54 - Nik: Did anything happen while I was away?
17/08/2023, 18:55 - EthanT: Not really, we tried to organise a meeting but we've had no response from sergey
17/08/2023, 18:58 - Nik: I see
17/08/2023, 18:59 - Nik: He seems like a “work hard & play hard” type of guy
17/08/2023, 18:59 - Nik: Which is fair
17/08/2023, 18:59 - Nik: A bit hard to organize this way
23/08/2023, 11:16 - EthanT: I'm going to email Sergey again today after work.
25/08/2023, 07:46 - Nik: Did he reply?
26/08/2023, 09:47 - EthanT: Nothing yet
27/08/2023, 21:13 - EthanT: I'll send another at the weekend
28/08/2023, 20:32 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
03/09/2023, 18:03 - Misha: We should come up with some questions here to ask Sergey as well
03/09/2023, 21:37 - EthanT: Agreed, when are people up for the meeting
03/09/2023, 22:08 - Misha: Evenings any day are good for me
04/09/2023, 08:22 - EthanT: Sounds good to me
04/09/2023, 09:21 - EthanT: As long as its after 6.30 on weekdays though
05/09/2023, 14:17 - Juan: I can also do any evening except Mondays
05/09/2023, 14:28 - Manuel Montero: I can do any days really
06/09/2023, 08:23 - EthanT: What about next Tuseday?
06/09/2023, 09:25 - EthanT: I've finished work by then so I'm good any time
06/09/2023, 10:08 - Misha: That’s good, can you do any days earlier?

09/09/2023, 18:45 - Manuel Montero: I will be in Venezuela from Wednesday, until the 28th! I’ll join but my connection might be very bad haha justin case
09/09/2023, 18:45 - EthanT: That's cool, I'll probably take notes during the meeting anyway
09/09/2023, 18:46 - Manuel Montero: Last time i was home my home broadband was 3Mbps 😭
09/09/2023, 18:46 - EthanT: 🤣🤣
09/09/2023, 19:14 - Nik: Nw, mate
09/09/2023, 19:14 - Nik: I’ll pray for you, Manu
12/09/2023, 11:57 - Nik: Guys, I realized something yesterday. You know I had to reset my phone and then give it for repair? Well, after that my Microsoft Authenticator app bugged and unlinked from my kent account. Now I cannot log in into my email, KV, and other. Do you know who I should email to ask for help?
12/09/2023, 11:58 - Misha: Should be a technical support option maybe? Or call someone from Kent technical support, that could be your best option
12/09/2023, 11:59 - Manuel Montero: You can do the IT Support Webchat
12/09/2023, 11:59 - EthanT: If its unlinked, wouldn't you no longer need to use it to sign in? Or is your account saved to it
12/09/2023, 11:59 - Nik: I see, thank you for the suggestions
12/09/2023, 11:59 - Manuel Montero: https://www.kent.ac.uk/library/support/online-chat-window.html
12/09/2023, 11:59 - Manuel Montero: the account is saved
12/09/2023, 12:00 - EthanT: Ah, I thought it would be 2fa
12/09/2023, 12:00 - Manuel Montero: explain the situation and they will unlink the account. I recommend you set sms authentication first and add the authenticator parallel to it
12/09/2023, 12:01 - Manuel Montero: thing is the moment you try logging in from say a new phone, it asks you to press accept in the app, but the app is wiped so you enter that weird loop
12/09/2023, 12:01 - Manuel Montero: that’s why they recommend you have SMS as a backup option
12/09/2023, 12:01 - Manuel Montero: same thing happened to me last year too
12/09/2023, 12:02 - EthanT: Fair
12/09/2023, 12:02 - Nik: Will do if it is allowed
12/09/2023, 12:03 - Nik: EXACTLY
12/09/2023, 12:19 - Nik: Manu, you saved me here. I just set up the SMS authentication rn. Thank you. Only thing is that it didn't ask me to set the Microsoft Authenticator as well and now it is just SMS, but I'll figure out how to add it later.
12/09/2023, 12:49 - Manuel Montero: Yeah! You add it going to Account settings and security!
12/09/2023, 12:49 - Manuel Montero: Anytime bro! 💜
14/09/2023, 00:53 - EthanT: Is anyone able to email sergey at some point seeing if he can meet up for a meeting on Friday? I've emailed him a few times but haven't got a response yet
14/09/2023, 07:39 - Misha: Will email when I get back
15/09/2023, 13:05 - Nik: Any answer from him, Misha?
15/09/2023, 13:20 - Misha: No answer
15/09/2023, 13:20 - Misha: Idk i wrote it in the plane it said it went through
15/09/2023, 13:20 - Misha: But he prob didn’t read it
15/09/2023, 13:31 - EthanT: When does everyone return to Uni? We can at least plan meetings easier once everyone's there

25/09/2023, 19:09 - Misha: I don’t mind either, online would be convenient but in person would also be good, csn start with online
25/09/2023, 19:13 - EthanT: Sounds good I can create a meeting tomorrow
25/09/2023, 21:51 - Nik: I don’t mind, tbf
25/09/2023, 21:52 - Nik: It would be nice to have it in person the first time, but it is ok either way
25/09/2023, 21:52 - Nik: Great
25/09/2023, 21:52 - Nik: Btw do any of you have Enterprise Dev tomorrow morning?
25/09/2023, 21:53 - Manuel Montero: I won’t be in UK yet on Wednesday
25/09/2023, 21:53 - Misha: No what’s that? A module?
25/09/2023, 21:55 - EthanT: No I only have Internet of Things in the morning

https://livekentac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/et365_kent_ac_uk/Documents/Group%20Project%20Overview.docx?d=w6fb5d84d3210450cb3839235f61930a6&csf=1&web=1&e=jt4Oax

Ill create a shared folder at some point so we can store all this together.
26/09/2023, 22:01 - Misha: We should come up with some questions so at least we have something to ask, if anyone has any just put them here I guess
27/09/2023, 11:44 - EthanT: I assume we're all going to join the meeting from home
27/09/2023, 12:37 - Misha: Yeah

27/09/2023, 14:37 - EthanT: Found an android IDE, ill send a link to it if it works ok
27/09/2023, 14:38 - Nik: Meeting points (27.09.2023 - 1st meeting)

no strict marking scheme
well organised codebase
good interface
unique features
(they got around 80)
think about what programming language to use (Kotlin maybe)
27/09/2023, 14:38 - Nik: Kotlin is very heavily marketed, we can check it out
27/09/2023, 14:38 - Nik: it works in ItenlliJ, which is a huge selling point for me
27/09/2023, 14:39 - EthanT: ive just download the officla android studio
27/09/2023, 14:39 - Nik: because anything else would probably requre us to use VS Code. I'll be able to check everythng tommorrow, though, because today is going to be busy.
27/09/2023, 14:40 - EthanT: all good, ive got nothing till 7 so ill investigate now
27/09/2023, 14:40 - Manuel Montero: same here, I use IntelliJ a lot
28/09/2023, 13:10 - EthanT: Just testing out Android Studio. It utilises Koltin and Android Studio allows for a live emulator inside the app
28/09/2023, 17:08 - Nik: Btw may someone add me back in?
28/09/2023, 17:08 - Nik: <Media omitted>

29/09/2023, 16:29 - Misha: For managing our timelines, meetings, goals and etc, I know a good software that we can use, it’s called Notion and it’s pretty easy to use and learn
29/09/2023, 16:29 - EthanT: Perfect
29/09/2023, 16:29 - Manuel Montero: Im all for that!
29/09/2023, 16:29 - Manuel Montero: I’d love to learn project management tbh
29/09/2023, 16:31 - Misha: I could do it and then bounce ideas off you?
29/09/2023, 16:31 - Misha: And off everyone else in the group
29/09/2023, 16:31 - Manuel Montero: Yes that would be great! 🤩
29/09/2023, 16:31 - Manuel Montero: I’m finally back in GB
29/09/2023, 16:31 - Misha: We’d all be contributing to each others sections in a way it’s just that we would each have our individual sections 😄
29/09/2023, 16:31 - Misha: Awesome!!
29/09/2023, 16:33 - Misha: I’ll create the notion page soon and add everyone there
29/09/2023, 18:08 - EthanT: Me and nik were discussing the IDE we can use for the project. 

Android Studio is one that I found, the official andorid app creator of which uses Java or Kotlin. It also has a UI creator so instead of coding one, we simply click and drag. There's also a a virtual device simulator so changes can be seen on a range of devices. 

Since the file system isn't unique to Android Studio, it may be possible for the project to be done in either IntelliJ or Android Studio. May be an idea to understand the basics of either though.
29/09/2023, 18:08 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
29/09/2023, 18:11 - Misha: Both sound good to me, I’ve installed IntelliJ yesterday and it also seems nice
30/09/2023, 11:34 - Misha: I'm working on the Notion page right now, it should be done in a few hours and I'll post it here and do a quick video tutorial on how to use the pages effectively so we can all use it well together
30/09/2023, 12:44 - EthanT: Lmk when someone has IntelliJ running, I have a test file for an andorid app
30/09/2023, 15:46 - Misha: I have it if you want to try
30/09/2023, 16:15 - Juan: I use intelij a lot but android studio seems to be more suitable for our project. The UI creator can save us a lot of time 😄
30/09/2023, 16:15 - Juan: I will download it today and test it out as well
30/09/2023, 16:52 - Misha: <Media omitted>
30/09/2023, 16:54 - Misha: https://www.notion.so/8ae860bfae68431b8c073b44903b39f4?v=ed0aa0699a4048cc9e207f5d6068c47c&pvs=4
30/09/2023, 18:28 - EthanT: I signed up with my personal, but says I don't have permission
30/09/2023, 18:30 - Misha: Alright then maybe send your email and I’ll add personally invite you
30/09/2023, 18:30 - Misha: Because as I can see that’s the main way of inviting
30/09/2023, 18:31 - EthanT: teatherethan@gmail.com
30/09/2023, 18:33 - Misha: Ok try now
30/09/2023, 18:33 - Misha: Refresh
30/09/2023, 18:34 - Misha: I tried doing it on my phone if it doesn’t work I’ll just do it properly when I get back home
30/09/2023, 18:41 - Misha: Did you manage to gain access @447514583905 ?
30/09/2023, 18:41 - EthanT: Give me a few min
30/09/2023, 18:43 - EthanT: Yh I'm in, I'll look in detail when I get back from food
30/09/2023, 18:44 - Misha: No problem, there’s a lot of random stuff there I’ll delete it later as well
30/09/2023, 18:46 - EthanT: All good
30/09/2023, 20:07 - Misha: @359882808200 @447452833836 @447753129330  send me your emails as well I’ll invite you guys
30/09/2023, 20:15 - Manuel Montero: Hey! sorry I just got to campus and I took a nap hahah
30/09/2023, 20:15 - Manuel Montero: mamonme4@gmail.com
30/09/2023, 20:29 - Misha: Added, let me know if you're in
30/09/2023, 23:39 - Juan: Here it is juandasa74@gmail.com
30/09/2023, 23:39 - Juan: Sorry I just saw the message
30/09/2023, 23:41 - Misha: No prob, added you
01/10/2023, 01:03 - Misha: You guys should have access to 4 pages in total, let me know if you don't, this stuff is confusing sometimes :D
01/10/2023, 01:04 - Misha: This message was deleted
01/10/2023, 01:04 - Misha: <Media omitted>
01/10/2023, 14:31 - Nik: I jsut downloaded notion on my phone, looks cool
01/10/2023, 14:32 - Nik: Nice :)
01/10/2023, 14:33 - Nik: I reasearched a bit and Android Studio seems like a great IDE to do the project in. Let's all download it.
01/10/2023, 14:34 - Nik: IntelliJ is great, I hope that we are able to use both of them simutaneously
01/10/2023, 14:35 - Nik: nikola.kolev1213@gmail.com
01/10/2023, 14:36 - Manuel Montero: I’ll download Android Studio tonight when I get back from work!
01/10/2023, 14:39 - Nik: Guys, regarding the language choice - Java turned out to be one of the main choices for a language to base android apps on
01/10/2023, 14:40 - Nik: It is even more popular than Kotlin, even though Google made Kotlin the official one, because java is older and a lot of people don't want to transition their app to the new one'
01/10/2023, 14:40 - Nik: so we can choose either and I suggest that we select the one we are more comfortable with - Java
01/10/2023, 14:41 - Nik: do you agree?
01/10/2023, 14:41 - Nik: Also we should ask Sergey to create a Git Lab project and invite us to it. I will email him and have all of you in cc
01/10/2023, 14:42 - EthanT: Sounds good.
@447985120259 is there a file system on notion? I have some documents outlining potential parts of the project we can do in each step, as well as some mockups for the UI
01/10/2023, 14:54 - Nik: email sent <This message was edited>
01/10/2023, 14:54 - Nik: <Media omitted>
01/10/2023, 15:01 - Nik: I am still debating here though. I am open to using Kotlin as well. My take on it is - whatever you all want, I am fine.
01/10/2023, 15:04 - EthanT: In terms of steps for the project, we could aim to do this;

1. Login Page, Register Page, Home Page (for now a blank page, initualised in next step), database creation
2. Welcome Page, Statistics, Settings
3. New Activity, Activity History, 
4. AI Implementation, Testing

We have roughly 4 months until partial submission (assuming we start soon), giving us a month per step. If we aim to plan for the next stage a week before we start it, we can give us enough time in the actual step to plan.
For example, in the last week of step 1, we can start to plan step 2 and finalise step 1. It gives us a solid amount of time and a time buffer as well. Even if in the final week of a step we take an additional meeting to reflect on how the project is going so far and whether there are major issues.
01/10/2023, 15:05 - EthanT: Im going to begin learning Android Studio over the next week so we could to begin roughly in a weeks time
01/10/2023, 15:34 - Misha: I definitely think there is, just type it up or I can do it when I'm online, it should basically have everything
01/10/2023, 15:35 - Misha: Invited you @359882808200
01/10/2023, 22:33 - Misha: @447514583905 did you manage to find the file system? If not I can have a look
01/10/2023, 22:33 - EthanT: Ill have a quick look now
01/10/2023, 22:33 - Misha: Ok cool
01/10/2023, 22:37 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
01/10/2023, 22:38 - Misha: Yeah
02/10/2023, 11:28 - Nik: Hey, I just saw the invite. Thank you. I have access now :)
02/10/2023, 11:29 - Nik: I believe we can do even better, but yeah - that's a solid plan
02/10/2023, 11:29 - Misha: 👍👍
02/10/2023, 11:31 - EthanT: Sure, it was only a rough plan
02/10/2023, 11:31 - Nik: 👍
02/10/2023, 12:44 - EthanT: I'm also creating a document where we can post questions to each other about the project, easier way of storing them there rather than on WhatsApp
02/10/2023, 17:59 - Nik: Is it this one?
02/10/2023, 17:59 - Nik: <Media omitted>
02/10/2023, 17:59 - Nik: the untitled one?
02/10/2023, 18:00 - EthanT: No I haven't uploaded it yet
02/10/2023, 18:01 - Nik: Oh, ok. I am deleting this one then. It is empty.
02/10/2023, 18:11 - Nik: <Media omitted>
02/10/2023, 18:11 - Nik: <Media omitted>
02/10/2023, 18:11 - EthanT: Cool
02/10/2023, 18:13 - Nik: will do that for key points and key components as well, trying to structure it more
02/10/2023, 18:13 - Nik: I also moved the GDPR Section at the bottom
02/10/2023, 18:14 - EthanT: 👍
02/10/2023, 18:36 - Nik: Btw, since most of us have used MySQL for last year's project, have experience with, and and have it already downloaded on our laptops, I suggest using it for the DB
02/10/2023, 18:40 - EthanT: Just removed parts of the overview explaining differnt os since that's not needed
02/10/2023, 18:40 - EthanT: Queries document is created
02/10/2023, 18:41 - Nik: Great
02/10/2023, 18:42 - Nik: I am done formatting Key Points and Components as well
02/10/2023, 18:43 - Nik: I left bank lines before each section for readibilities sake
02/10/2023, 18:44 - Nik: *readability
02/10/2023, 18:45 - EthanT: 👍
02/10/2023, 18:46 - Nik: <Media omitted>
02/10/2023, 18:46 - Nik: I was just thinking about the color palette, I swear
02/10/2023, 18:47 - EthanT: 😅 I don't know how to format on mobile
02/10/2023, 18:47 - Nik: nw
02/10/2023, 18:47 - Nik: I was going to say that imo green, red, or green and red are good main colors, since they are medical / health / sports / healthy eating colors
02/10/2023, 18:48 - Nik: I'll add that to the doc on Noting.
02/10/2023, 18:49 - Nik: Will also create a doc to upload mockups and decide on the design before coding it
02/10/2023, 18:51 - EthanT: I'll probably upload the mockups as an image, I'll see
02/10/2023, 18:52 - Nik: So you have done some?
02/10/2023, 18:52 - EthanT: Yh
02/10/2023, 18:52 - Nik: That's what I would do as well
02/10/2023, 18:52 - EthanT: Need to change the colours now lol
02/10/2023, 18:52 - Nik: What do you create them on btw?
02/10/2023, 18:53 - EthanT: Publisher, Andorid Studio as well
02/10/2023, 19:02 - Nik: I see
02/10/2023, 19:07 - Nik: I may use Canva, but I'll wait for you to upload yours, so that we don't do the same thing twice. I guess you did the welcome page - the one with the registration, login, and anon buttons? Anyways, I think I'll hop off for today.
02/10/2023, 19:08 - EthanT: Yep, I did Android Studio to give a more realistic idea of what is achievable.
02/10/2023, 20:08 - Misha: I think I have an idea of the navigation system, but I'm also gonna download a bunch of health and fitness apps and see how they do it haha
02/10/2023, 20:09 - EthanT: Good idea, I can do that as well
02/10/2023, 20:09 - Misha: Does anyone know, from their knowledge, will the IDE and what we're using to make the app be able to create smooth animations etc
02/10/2023, 20:09 - Nik: I was doing that this afternoon haha
02/10/2023, 20:09 - Misha: with*
02/10/2023, 20:10 - Nik: Idk, @447514583905?
02/10/2023, 20:10 - Misha: Or are we sticking to a basic design, e.g. static icons, limited animations?
02/10/2023, 20:10 - EthanT: As in a popup appearing smoothly?
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Misha: Yeah like fancy animations
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Nik: Or moving between the pages, probably
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Misha: Idk how to explain it haha
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Nik: I believe it should be capable
02/10/2023, 20:11 - EthanT: I think so
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Misha: Because of you know...
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Misha: Java
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Misha: Idk I might be wrong
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Nik: Java is able to do that, I believe
02/10/2023, 20:11 - Misha: Shouldn't be hating on Java
02/10/2023, 20:12 - Misha: Alrigh
02/10/2023, 20:16 - EthanT: We can also start to think of a bane for the App
02/10/2023, 20:16 - Misha: Wait what's that?
02/10/2023, 20:16 - EthanT: *name
02/10/2023, 20:17 - Misha: I'll think of something the next time I shower :)
02/10/2023, 20:18 - EthanT: ngl, thats where I had the idea for the app 🤣🤣
02/10/2023, 20:19 - Misha: Also, at the moment, our app plan is quite good, I feel like we should make it stand out a bit more from all the other health and fitness apps, everyone could think of some functionalities that we can implement as we go when working on the app, maybe integrating google maps to see how far the person walked, that kind of thing
02/10/2023, 20:20 - EthanT: the main selling point so far is the offline functionality, I haven't seen many apps so that work entirely offline. the anomnyous mode can be too
02/10/2023, 20:20 - Nik: Googles map api is very dev friendly, that’s a good idea
02/10/2023, 20:21 - Misha: Yeah keep thinking of anything in the next few days or weeks and if you feel like you have some sort of idea, just write it down here or in notion
02/10/2023, 20:22 - Misha: That'll be interesting to implement, should be good
02/10/2023, 20:23 - Nik: <Media omitted>
02/10/2023, 20:23 - Nik: Write all these here 😁
02/10/2023, 21:05 - EthanT: Added the first mockup with a comment. Not the best, but ok for a first draw. The font is the only thing im not a fan of for now. The apple is a placeholder, we can either remove or change it at some point
03/10/2023, 09:06 - Misha: Does anyone have the iot lecture code if they could send it, thanks guys
03/10/2023, 09:08 - EthanT: oknudn
03/10/2023, 09:49 - EthanT: Added a few more design to Notion
03/10/2023, 10:02 - EthanT: Does anyone plan on using IntelliJ for the project?
03/10/2023, 11:03 - Nik: I’ll try android studio
03/10/2023, 11:03 - Nik: I’ve heard that it’s similar
03/10/2023, 14:51 - EthanT: More or less, yh
03/10/2023, 17:36 - Nik: Let’s do our first meeting sometime tomorrow
03/10/2023, 17:40 - Nik: @447452833836 @447753129330 @447985120259 @447514583905
03/10/2023, 17:46 - Manuel Montero: i can anytime tomorrow! x
03/10/2023, 17:47 - EthanT: Whenever is cool with me
03/10/2023, 23:22 - Nik: 10 or 11 AM?
03/10/2023, 23:22 - Nik: Would you all be available at that time?
03/10/2023, 23:22 - Misha: I’m available more in the afternoon
03/10/2023, 23:22 - Misha: Or evening
03/10/2023, 23:23 - Nik: I suggest to meet at the library
03/10/2023, 23:23 - Misha: Got training in the morning
03/10/2023, 23:23 - Nik: Hmm, I won’t be able to meet at the evening, maybe early afternoon…
03/10/2023, 23:23 - Nik: Is it on campus?
03/10/2023, 23:23 - Misha: Oop I can try making it at 10
03/10/2023, 23:24 - Misha: Forgot it’s Wednesday
03/10/2023, 23:24 - Misha: After the cognitive lecture
03/10/2023, 23:24 - Nik: Oh, okay, great
03/10/2023, 23:25 - Nik: Do you all agree, guys
03/10/2023, 23:46 - EthanT: Sounds good
03/10/2023, 23:48 - EthanT: Prefer 11 but i can work with either
04/10/2023, 08:40 - Misha: Is 10 okay with you guys?
04/10/2023, 08:43 - Misha: Or 10:30
04/10/2023, 09:04 - Nik: Anyone has the code for neural??
04/10/2023, 09:04 - Misha: Going there now
04/10/2023, 09:06 - Nik: Me too
04/10/2023, 09:07 - Misha: syotfe
04/10/2023, 09:12 - Nik: Ty
04/10/2023, 09:57 - Nik: Where are you all?
04/10/2023, 10:01 - EthanT: I can be there in 30
04/10/2023, 10:02 - Nik: Cool
04/10/2023, 10:05 - Juan: I can't make it in the morning
04/10/2023, 10:05 - Juan: But I can make any time after 12
04/10/2023, 10:10 - Nik: Well, I guess we can meet with everyone that’s available today
04/10/2023, 10:10 - Nik: And then arrange another date to meet all
04/10/2023, 10:18 - Juan: Ok cool
04/10/2023, 10:18 - Juan: Please let me know about the outcome of the meeting
04/10/2023, 11:17 - Misha: <Media omitted>
04/10/2023, 11:18 - Nik: <Media omitted>
04/10/2023, 11:42 - Nik: Guys, we decided that we are going to do it on GitHub
04/10/2023, 11:42 - Nik: What are your GitHub usernames @447753129330 @447452833836
04/10/2023, 11:53 - Nik: Also - when are you going to be able to meet? Sergey sent us his availability and this time slots seem to work best for me, Misha and Ethan:
Monday between 13 and 14:00
Tuesday between 12 and 13:00
Friday between 11 and 12:00
04/10/2023, 11:54 - Nik: And I also suggest that we meet a second time on Wednesday, before lunchtime
04/10/2023, 12:51 - Manuel Montero: mine is mam85
04/10/2023, 12:51 - Manuel Montero: wth i slept through all my alarms
04/10/2023, 12:51 - Manuel Montero: 😭
04/10/2023, 13:04 - Juan: Monday and Friday are both good for me
04/10/2023, 13:04 - Juan: I can't on Tuesday though
04/10/2023, 13:05 - Juan: jdsal10
05/10/2023, 21:26 - Misha: I think Monday is better for me, unless we do 5
06/10/2023, 16:10 - Nik: invited
06/10/2023, 16:10 - Nik: <Media omitted>
06/10/2023, 16:11 - Nik: <Media omitted>
06/10/2023, 16:12 - Manuel Montero: thank youuu
06/10/2023, 16:15 - Nik: Do we all agree on Monday  -from 13:00 to 14:00?
06/10/2023, 16:16 - Manuel Montero: I think that works for me
06/10/2023, 16:24 - Nik: for me and Ethan as well
06/10/2023, 16:24 - Nik: Juan and Misha agreed earlier as well
06/10/2023, 16:25 - Nik: so I'll text Sergey now
06/10/2023, 16:25 - Nik: Also, apparently, GitLab works now, so I'll try to create a new repo over there and invite y;all
06/10/2023, 16:50 - Nik: Created it on GitLab, invited you all, test committed, created a blank Android Studio project and now we are ready to rock
06/10/2023, 16:53 - Misha: Thanks, I'll try to find my password to it now!
06/10/2023, 16:54 - Nik: After cloning the repo, please create local branches and commit there when coding. If you don’t know how to do all that, consider downloading Git for desktop. The GUI makes it a lot more intuitive. If you are still having issues, maybe wait till our meeting on Monday. I believe though that we all will be fine with that. Have a nice weekend, team.
06/10/2023, 18:17 - EthanT: Next step once we're happy with the repo, we can move on the mockups, so we can be happy with the design and start the creation
09/10/2023, 09:12 - Nik: We are meeting today, correct
09/10/2023, 09:12 - Nik: ?
09/10/2023, 09:14 - Manuel Montero: I have to pick up some documents at the Venezuelan Embassy in London today, but I’m coming back earlish what time are we thinking?
09/10/2023, 11:50 - Nik: Well, I was thinking between 13 and 14
09/10/2023, 11:50 - Nik: since we all agreed on that time
09/10/2023, 11:50 - Nik: .
09/10/2023, 11:50 - Manuel Montero: ill be back by then! I’m coming back now
09/10/2023, 11:50 - Nik: That's great
09/10/2023, 11:51 - Nik: what about you, guys @447985120259 @447452833836 @447514583905 ?
09/10/2023, 11:58 - Juan: Yes I am able
09/10/2023, 12:00 - Manuel Montero: The train arrives in Canterbury at 13:30, can you guys wait for me? I’ll take the bus up so shouldn’t be that long
09/10/2023, 12:05 - Misha: I was good for that like 30 min ago but now my bike broke down and I’m severely behind
09/10/2023, 12:05 - Misha: I can join on call possibly?
09/10/2023, 12:05 - Misha: Sorry about that
09/10/2023, 12:08 - EthanT: I'm still good for 1, is it in person? I'm heading back to Canterbury after the meeting so I'd have to join online
09/10/2023, 12:21 - Juan: Should we do an online meeting at 1.40 then?
09/10/2023, 12:23 - Nik: I thought we are going to do it in person, so maybe it is better to just wait for you and do it at 1:30 or 1:45 then
09/10/2023, 12:23 - Nik: I suggest to go to the Kennedy building, since there will be free rooms there, I think
09/10/2023, 12:23 - Nik: Do you think you’ll be able to do it for 1:30 or 1:45, or not, @447985120259 ?
09/10/2023, 12:24 - Manuel Montero: Perfect! I’ll rush as fast as possible haha
09/10/2023, 12:27 - EthanT: We may have to delay it, I won't be I'm Canterbury until 2, takes over an hour to drive there. I need to get food as well
09/10/2023, 12:29 - EthanT: Or I can do it online
09/10/2023, 12:40 - Nik: Hmmm, well, you guys decide
09/10/2023, 12:42 - Nik: I personally think that Ethan might skip this one since the main focus is to discuss our organization, create local repos, branch out of the main branch, download android studio and get everyone up to pace.
09/10/2023, 12:42 - Nik: And he’s okay with all of that
09/10/2023, 12:43 - Nik: Bit if you prefer all of us to meet, we can wait for him
09/10/2023, 12:44 - Nik: Otherwise I would suggest that we meet at 13:45 at Kennedy and Ethan join us by 14:15-30 for the final organizational talk
09/10/2023, 12:45 - Misha: I can still join online though
09/10/2023, 12:46 - Misha: If anyone could call me at the time of the meeting it would be much appreciated 👍
09/10/2023, 12:47 - Misha: Because I can still contribute. Plus I can write down whatever we talk about and share it here so that we all have access to it even after the meeting
09/10/2023, 12:47 - Misha: How does that sound?
09/10/2023, 12:51 - Juan: 13:45 at Kennedy is good with me
09/10/2023, 12:51 - EthanT: Alot of those I can help with but sure
09/10/2023, 13:20 - Nik: We must keep a meeting log btw
09/10/2023, 13:21 - Nik: But do you need help with them? I think you don’t. If someone else does, I’ll help them.
09/10/2023, 13:21 - Nik: So basically it will be me, Manu and Juan, right?
09/10/2023, 13:21 - Manuel Montero: in person, I believe
09/10/2023, 13:21 - Nik: And Misha will join online
09/10/2023, 13:22 - Misha: Yeah I can create a separate page for those
09/10/2023, 13:22 - Nik: This would be great
09/10/2023, 13:23 - EthanT: Am I joining not online too
09/10/2023, 13:23 - Misha: Shall we do a discord call or teams?
09/10/2023, 13:28 - Nik: But later, correct?
09/10/2023, 13:28 - Nik: I am fine with both
09/10/2023, 13:28 - Misha: yeah just do discord
09/10/2023, 13:28 - Misha: easier

09/10/2023, 13:34 - Misha: You can just call me
09/10/2023, 13:35 - Manuel Montero: So the next bus is at 13:42, according to the Stagecoach app, hopefully one shows up earlier.

17/10/2023, 17:59 - EthanT: Me and misha decided yesterday that we're going to switch from Notion to Monday.com, it's much easier to use and has more functionalities. I will add everyone later
17/10/2023, 18:00 - Manuel Montero: Yeah I personally find Notion a bit confusing
17/10/2023, 18:01 - Misha: Yeah too big of a learning curve, no time for that 😂
17/10/2023, 18:01 - EthanT: Also is anyone free to meet at the library tomorrow? I'll be there for some of the day  if anyone wants to join
18/10/2023, 09:12 - Nik: Are we meeting at the library today?

18/10/2023, 10:53 - Nik: Shall we decide on a meeting time?
18/10/2023, 10:54 - Nik: Like 11:30 or 11:45 maybe?
18/10/2023, 10:54 - EthanT: Should be good
18/10/2023, 10:54 - Nik: Which one
18/10/2023, 10:54 - EthanT: Go for 11.45
18/10/2023, 10:55 - Nik: Great, that would be easier for me, 11:30 might have been impossible.
18/10/2023, 10:55 - Nik: Anyone else joining btw?
18/10/2023, 11:06 - EthanT: I've just remembered, I need to go to the Hackspace at 12 to pick up some hardware for Internet of Things, I'll drop my bag off at the library then ill quickly over there, shouldn't be too long
18/10/2023, 11:22 - Nik: Well, in that case I won’t rush to the library at 11:45

18/10/2023, 11:24 - EthanT: Cool, I'm waiting for food at Gulbenkain anyway

18/10/2023, 15:10 - Nik: BUT
18/10/2023, 15:10 - Nik: IT WORKS
18/10/2023, 15:10 - Nik: BUT… we will have to do it with all of you again
18/10/2023, 15:11 - Nik: There is a new repo, which you will have to clone, then open, then do changes, and then commit on a separate branch that you then merge with main…
18/10/2023, 15:11 - Nik: I know… sorry
18/10/2023, 15:11 - Nik: Let’s meet tomorrow maybe???
18/10/2023, 15:18 - Nik: I prefer to share the repo with you one by one and show you what to do in the beginning, because it is very easy to mess up and break it and I tell you that we don't want that happening.
18/10/2023, 15:19 - Manuel Montero: i can tomorrow but not all day bear with
18/10/2023, 15:19 - Nik: what about between 11 and 12

24/10/2023, 14:41 - Nik: <Media omitted>
24/10/2023, 14:43 - Nik: I am asking just to clarify, because I pulled and nothing changed to the view, there were changes only to the other files. I just want to make sure that there is no issue.
24/10/2023, 14:44 - EthanT: The names shouldn't be there and there should be some basic objects. Just checked on git and the changes are indeed there
24/10/2023, 14:44 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
24/10/2023, 14:45 - Nik: hmmm... strange

24/10/2023, 14:48 - EthanT: Yh, I haven't done the formatting yet
24/10/2023, 15:39 - EthanT: Another thing that someone can do is to design a logo. I can use a placeholder image for now

24/10/2023, 16:55 - Nik: Btw I pushed two commits

24/10/2023, 16:56 - Nik: It is not done by any means, but it starts to look like something
24/10/2023, 16:57 - Nik: I’ll try to figure out how to make the three different pages work together and will hopefully do another one or two commits in the next few days
24/10/2023, 16:58 - EthanT: Cool, I've got most of the layout for welcome done, I'll push it to main later

27/10/2023, 11:46 - Nik: Hey
27/10/2023, 11:46 - Nik: We haven’t started talking about the project yet 😂😂
27/10/2023, 11:47 - Misha: After the meeting I mean 😂
27/10/2023, 11:48 - Misha: Thanks
27/10/2023, 11:48 - Misha: Sorry I can’t make it, coming back only this evening
27/10/2023, 13:13 - Misha: @447856791314 have you guys finished?
27/10/2023, 15:02 - EthanT: Just pushed a pretty major commit, @447452833836 I was able to fix the Java class file not showing. For now, if you need a new page, go to File > New > Activity > Gallery > Empty Views Activity. SET the name to what you want, it will put "Activity" at thr start automatically and make sure the language is java. 

I have the buttons now functional skills you can test if your pages work correctly
28/10/2023, 18:56 - Nik: I've uploaded the meeting log from yesterday to the project repo
28/10/2023, 18:56 - Nik: The most important stuff is noted there.
28/10/2023, 18:57 - Nik: I just saw that an hour ago - well done! This allowed me to do some work on the Registration page
28/10/2023, 18:57 - EthanT: I messaged  Misha the details of what we done as well
28/10/2023, 18:58 - Nik: Just right now I pushed a major commit as well. I wrote the logic and functinality behind the Back and Continue buttons in the register page and they work :)
28/10/2023, 18:58 - Misha: Thanks
28/10/2023, 19:00 - Nik: Basically, the 3 pages are hidden initially and the onCreate makes p1 visible. then continue makes the current page invisible and sets the next one visible. Back does the opposite. Only difference is when you click Back from p1, you go back to the Welcome page. When you click Continue from p3, nothing happens rn.
28/10/2023, 19:00 - Nik: Pull the changes and play with it when you all have time 🎉
29/10/2023, 15:44 - Misha: Hey guys, for the tomorrows meeting, do we know if Sergey and you guys are able to make it earlier? I have a doctors appointment at 1. I will get my part partially done and commited on gitlab with comments so sergey can see by tomorrow anyway if we can’t reschedule and I don’t make it.

30/10/2023, 14:26 - EthanT: Many thanks for getting the forgot password pages done, I'll get the functionality done now
30/10/2023, 14:26 - Misha: Thanks 🙏
30/10/2023, 14:26 - Misha: No worries, I need to add their layouts because rn everything will be moved to 0,0

30/10/2023, 17:49 - Misha: I can work on that
30/10/2023, 18:12 - EthanT: Also does anyone know if we are able to use external libraries for the project?
30/10/2023, 18:27 - Misha: Gmail for consistency imo
31/10/2023, 10:01 - EthanT: In this case, I've created a Google work account, I'll add the passwords here and to the git later. I'm currently working on getting access to the api to send emails
01/11/2023, 18:14 - Nik: Hey, guys, today I spent some time on the project again. Wanted to maybe create the ChatGPT account that we are going to use to connect to the API, but instead focused on the registration page and finished everything I wanted to add to id. Rn it is pretty much ready. Only fonts and colors have to be changed, but this is a separate task. I need to connect to the db as well, but I am waiting Manu for that.
01/11/2023, 18:15 - Nik: @447753129330 , when are you going to be ready with the db implementation?
01/11/2023, 18:18 - EthanT: I belive I have a fix the forgot my password, trying it after dinner. Once done, all that left is to connect it to the database so the users password can be updated
01/11/2023, 18:18 - Manuel Montero: Hi! Sorry I’ve been MIA I’ve been working 😭. I wanna finish all of it tonight, I just wanna make sure it’s good and working at least but I’ve had so much shit going on this week it’s derailed my kifep
01/11/2023, 18:19 - EthanT: No worries, take the time you need. For now, we're pretty good for time anyway
01/11/2023, 18:21 - Nik: I see. I hope you get back on track with everything soon :)
01/11/2023, 18:24 - Manuel Montero: Thank you guys I’m sorry I’ve been so all over the place. I’m working towards recovering and refocusing 💜
01/11/2023, 18:25 - EthanT: No need to appoliges, hope you feel better soon 👍
01/11/2023, 18:29 - Nik: Btw don't foget to pull all the changes, before writing new code
01/11/2023, 18:29 - Nik: <Media omitted>
01/11/2023, 18:29 - Nik: because wright now you are 77 commits behind
01/11/2023, 18:30 - Nik: And if you start editing something without pulling, 99% there will occure an error on merging later
01/11/2023, 18:30 - Manuel Montero: Oh shit, yeah I haven’t pulled in a few days
01/11/2023, 18:30 - Manuel Montero: I’ll pull now
01/11/2023, 18:30 - Nik: *right
01/11/2023, 18:30 - Manuel Montero: True, I’ve been mostly done it outside the IDE, with SQL first
01/11/2023, 18:31 - Nik: Great :)

Test the app out a few times to check the emails are sent and received on your end
01/11/2023, 20:33 - EthanT: For now, thats as much as I can do since I need the users database created with tempory values
02/11/2023, 21:33 - EthanT: Is anyone up to meet tomorrow?
02/11/2023, 22:54 - Misha: Yeah I’m down, how about 4?

03/11/2023, 15:19 - EthanT: If need be, we can push the meeting forward to 4.30, I dont know how long the meeting will take but I can catch up and discuss what we went over after
03/11/2023, 15:20 - Misha: Nono keep it 4 better so it doesn’t complicate everyone else
03/11/2023, 15:20 - Misha: I can always catch up with anyone online worst case scenario
03/11/2023, 15:29 - Misha: I’ll be on campus till 6 anyway if someone stays
03/11/2023, 15:29 - EthanT: I can
03/11/2023, 15:29 - Misha: Good stuff
03/11/2023, 15:31 - Juan: I actually need to pick up some stuff from hack space as well so doing it later is fine with me
03/11/2023, 15:52 - Nik: If I am the only one up for after 10 mins - do it later without me
03/11/2023, 15:52 - Nik: And just tell me what happened
03/11/2023, 15:52 - Nik: Otherwise I am on my way rn
03/11/2023, 15:52 - EthanT: All good, ill be there in 5
03/11/2023, 15:53 - Nik: Should I go home or continue to Kennedy?

03/11/2023, 16:00 - Nik: <Media omitted>
03/11/2023, 16:04 - Nik: @447753129330 , with Ethan we are here
03/11/2023, 16:31 - Nik: Tim Bishop - SQL Hosting
03/11/2023, 16:41 - Misha: @359882808200 @447514583905which room are you in?
03/11/2023, 16:41 - EthanT: Were in the lobby
03/11/2023, 16:41 - Misha: Ok, the bus is late so I’ll come straight to you guys instead of hackspace
03/11/2023, 16:42 - Misha: See you soon
03/11/2023, 16:49 - Nik: I just left, but the rest are still there
03/11/2023, 16:50 - Misha: No worries, I’m about 7 min away
03/11/2023, 16:54 - Manuel Montero: i just saw u walking haha
03/11/2023, 16:54 - Misha: 😂
03/11/2023, 16:54 - Misha: Are you coming?
03/11/2023, 16:54 - Misha: I can wait if you are
05/11/2023, 19:49 - Nik: Hey all
05/11/2023, 19:50 - Nik: I just created the openAI account
05/11/2023, 19:50 - Nik: it is linked with my phone and my debit card
05/11/2023, 19:50 - Nik: I purchesed our first tokens
05/11/2023, 19:50 - Nik: they cost 6$
05/11/2023, 19:53 - Nik: I don't think that we will need to do a lot of purchases, but we have to see the different gpt models and decide whta are we going to use. There are a lot of models and the pricing is different for each
05/11/2023, 19:54 - Nik: Maybe everything will cost 5$ a person in the end, idk
05/11/2023, 19:54 - Nik: I think that it will be best if for now I pay all the bills and then send you the receipts in the end of the year to settle the money
05/11/2023, 19:55 - Misha: There should be a free model we can use
05/11/2023, 19:55 - Misha: They offer it
05/11/2023, 19:55 - Misha: And it allows for more than enough requests
05/11/2023, 19:55 - Nik: Which one
05/11/2023, 19:55 - Nik: As far as I know - using the api is paid
05/11/2023, 19:56 - Misha: The default one should be free, for a set amount of requests
05/11/2023, 19:56 - Nik: It may be a lot less though, it is hard to estimate
05/11/2023, 19:56 - Misha: I don’t remember which one though
05/11/2023, 19:56 - Misha: I don’t mind that if there’s no free version
05/11/2023, 19:58 - Nik: <Media omitted>
05/11/2023, 19:59 - Misha: Oh yes that’s what I meant
05/11/2023, 19:59 - Nik: <Media omitted>
05/11/2023, 19:59 - Nik: I see
05/11/2023, 19:59 - Nik: Well, later I will create a new account
05/11/2023, 21:33 - Nik: Did it - created a new account, which is linked to my kent email
05/11/2023, 21:33 - Nik: Unfortunately the trial money is only 5$, not 18. Still, better than nothing
05/11/2023, 21:34 - Nik: I will try and link it to the app now. Username and password are in the document.
05/11/2023, 22:42 - Nik: I couldn’t get it working today, but apparently there is some file that I need to modify to allow the app to access the internet. Probably that’s why I didn’t manage to do it. Hopefully in the next few days I’ll get around to it and get it done. I’ll keep you posted on that. Goon night, lads.
05/11/2023, 22:42 - Nik: *good
05/11/2023, 22:43 - EthanT: All good, I'm finishing the email seriously soon as well. Good night 👍
06/11/2023, 00:20 - EthanT: Do we still have a group meeting tomorrow?
06/11/2023, 00:21 - Nik: Maybe we should message Sergey
06/11/2023, 00:23 - EthanT: Sure, I'm in Canterbury around lunch time, but I should be back regardless

06/11/2023, 21:53 - Juan: But does it say that I committed??
06/11/2023, 21:54 - Juan: Cos I thought that I just fetched from main to my branch
06/11/2023, 21:55 - Juan: Yh I checked and your branch works fine
06/11/2023, 22:45 - EthanT: That may be of some code I added to connect to AWS RDS, amazons database. Appologies if its confused anyone, ill check now. Ill comment it out in main and keep it running in my branch until I get it fixed
06/11/2023, 22:50 - Juan: No worries, I just reverted the last three pushes on my branch and everything seems to be working now
06/11/2023, 22:51 - EthanT: Ah yh definitely it, I added a tempory implementation that points to a library in my downloads, Uploading a fix now
06/11/2023, 22:52 - EthanT: Commited. ll keep testing the connection in my branch and get it working before I push it
06/11/2023, 22:53 - Juan: Ok great 👍🏼
07/11/2023, 12:20 - Nik: I was not sure that you committed. I just saw that there were commits. Sorry for the misinformation.
07/11/2023, 12:21 - Nik: Btw just a heads up - I did some tidying up, creating some directories. That's how it looks like now:
07/11/2023, 12:22 - Nik: <Media omitted>
07/11/2023, 13:16 - Nik: Guys, next time you open the proj you'll see a Validator class in the Other directory. I've put all validation in this file. If you need to validate an email, dob, password or whatever, there might be a method in this validator class. If you don't find the method you are searching for, please add it, so that all validation is in that file.
07/11/2023, 13:16 - Nik: :)
07/11/2023, 13:19 - Manuel Montero: oh thank god thanks nikkk
07/11/2023, 13:19 - Manuel Montero: nice!!
07/11/2023, 18:44 - EthanT: Just pushiong a commit with ane xternal database fully operational. After changing services 3 times, I found a service that gives us 75 million requests, 5gb storage and a really good prices on additional stuff. Ill add a link to it in the documents later, its using the noreply google account. If you download the latest push and check the logcat some placeholder text should be there saying stuff like "table created". lmk if you have any problems. 
Also ill store the function in its own java file later, so other files can call on the connection file. Other than that, it operates as MySQL does
07/11/2023, 19:01 - EthanT: Commited now
07/11/2023, 20:08 - Nik: That’s GREAT NEWS 💪
07/11/2023, 20:08 - Nik: Good job
07/11/2023, 20:08 - Nik: I’ll try to pull and run maybe tomorrow
07/11/2023, 20:08 - Manuel Montero: That’s much better than locally tbbh
08/11/2023, 15:35 - Nik: Hey, all! I added some colors to the colors.xml file in the res/values dir. They are some color gradient combinations that I find beautiful. It would be nice if in one of our next meetings we try them out and see if something cathes our intrest. Feel free to add any other interesting gradient combinatins to the list. Pleasee usee the identified naming scheme :)
08/11/2023, 15:35 - Nik: <Media omitted>
09/11/2023, 15:21 - Nik: Hey, all. With Ethan we just met at the library and discussed the db design. He had an idea to use 3 tables instead of 5, but after some brainstorming, we decided that 5 will allow us to do more things and will be easier to use later. There was a file in Documents/Other called DB_Design.txt. We created a new one called DB_Design_v2 in there and wrote down the details of the new improved db. It is based on the first one, but more detailed and has some minor changes. You can reffer to it when creating the rest of the tables, @447753129330 :)
09/11/2023, 15:24 - Manuel Montero: Awesome! Ethan and I also discussed it last night, I’ll have a look when I get back to uni x

10/11/2023, 07:17 - Misha: After 5
10/11/2023, 09:13 - Nik: Yesterday I really wanted to meet, but then I got back home and tried to do the Comp Intelligence in Business and it turned out to be a lot harder than expected. I also have some work for New Enterprise Dev and Cognitive Neural Networks, so I will skip the project today. Please meet without me, I have absolutely no problem. Just keep a meeting log and upload it to the project afterwards, so that I can see what you have discussed.
10/11/2023, 10:59 - EthanT: I'm grabbing food, I'll be at Kennedy if people want to meet since I need to go hack space again 😅

27/11/2023, 17:02 - Nik: because I don't find the account details in the accounts directory
27/11/2023, 17:03 - EthanT: the account is the gmail account, ill get the name now
27/11/2023, 17:03 - Nik: ty
27/11/2023, 17:05 - Nik: Also, @447514583905, just to double-check before I do something stupid
27/11/2023, 17:05 - Nik: <Media omitted>
27/11/2023, 17:05 - EthanT: DBConnection is the only one we need
27/11/2023, 17:05 - Nik: In the DB package I can delete the last two Java classes and just leave DBConnection in there, right
27/11/2023, 17:05 - Nik: hahaha
27/11/2023, 17:06 - Nik: you knew what I was asking
27/11/2023, 17:06 - Nik: well, I am deleting them then
27/11/2023, 17:06 - EthanT: The others were used when we had a local database and were using sqlite
27/11/2023, 17:07 - EthanT: https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters

HealthStorage is the cluster we are using, use queires to check data. There is AI integration so it can generate sql statements if need be. account is the group gmail account
27/11/2023, 17:08 - Nik: That's what I remember from our last convo regarding the topic, yes
27/11/2023, 17:14 - Juan: Mucho ánimo Manu 👍
27/11/2023, 18:27 - Nik: @447452833836 , did you create that?
27/11/2023, 18:27 - Nik: <Media omitted>
27/11/2023, 18:42 - Nik: Also, to let you all know - today before and after the group meeting I spent some time on the proj.
27/11/2023, 18:42 - Nik: Some of the more major stuff I did are to initialize the necessary Java class and xml file for the workouts page, create a mockup for the Workouts - AI page, upload the meeting log, tidy up by deleting old Java classes, renaming files and re-formatting code, and, most importantly, create DBHelper, DataChecker and DataFormatter Java classes to ease and secure accessing the DB.
27/11/2023, 18:43 - Nik: DBChecker should contain different check methods to pass the data through, before sending it to the DB
27/11/2023, 18:45 - Nik: And DBFormatter would have different formatting methods for us to use if we need to manipulate the data somehow before sending it to the DB. For instance, I need  to check if a user entered his height when registering. If yes, I need to get what units he used. Based on that I format his input and then send it to the Db.
27/11/2023, 18:45 - Nik: I hope that you find them helpful
27/11/2023, 18:46 - EthanT: 👍
27/11/2023, 20:06 - Juan: No I didn't
27/11/2023, 20:06 - Juan: I don't know why my name is there
27/11/2023, 20:09 - EthanT: https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/nk465/comp6000_groupproject/-/commit/149c5ac813a321a29e82d92e4b53906d08955c6c

Seems like this commit added it
27/11/2023, 20:09 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
27/11/2023, 20:21 - Juan: It looks like that happened when I reverted the changes from main in my branch cos I was having compilation errors
27/11/2023, 20:22 - Juan: I'm guessing it kept a that class and then was uploaded when I pushed my additions
27/11/2023, 20:22 - EthanT: All good, doesnt look like anything was affected
27/11/2023, 20:22 - Juan: Cool
28/11/2023, 00:30 - Nik: I was wondering because I created that a while back
28/11/2023, 00:31 - Nik: But then changed it and gave it a new name
28/11/2023, 00:31 - Nik: And put it in a different package
28/11/2023, 00:31 - Nik: And now I saw that it came back haunting me
28/11/2023, 00:32 - Nik: I assumed something like that happened though, no worries
28/11/2023, 00:35 - EthanT: It was most likely part of a merge request that perhaps reverted it to its original form, its not causing any major issues right now so it's not a problem as of right now
30/11/2023, 21:25 - Nik: Look what I just found out in TiDB
30/11/2023, 21:25 - Nik: <Media omitted>
30/11/2023, 22:11 - Nik: Also, registration is finally connected to the DB 🎉
02/12/2023, 18:07 - Nik: Hey, all, I am working on a sitemap page that will have links to all other pages in the app. The idea behind that page is purely to ease the dev process.
02/12/2023, 18:26 - EthanT: We have a hand written one I made a few weeks back, but we can have a digital one  as well
02/12/2023, 18:26 - Nik: It is done already, you can pull and try it out
02/12/2023, 18:28 - EthanT: Sure
02/12/2023, 18:29 - Nik: Also I realized that we’re going to need two DBs. An up-to-date online db and a smaller, not so up-to-date local db. That is for the offline functionality. How is that going to work exactly - I don’t know. 🤷
02/12/2023, 18:30 - EthanT: I plan to discuss that with the team on monday
02/12/2023, 18:31 - EthanT: Mainly since it will correlate with anonymous login
02/12/2023, 18:32 - Nik: I will be on my way to Germany for Asya’s surgery on Monday, so I won’t be able to join you in person. I will probably not be able to join online either. I should be able to join online on Sunday or Tuesday though. If you all are down to talk to Sergey, we can ask if he is interested in moving this week’s meeting. If you have plans, though, then I’ll just skip the meeting, but will give you a list of everything I’ve done this week.
02/12/2023, 18:33 - EthanT: Will do.
02/12/2023, 19:34 - Nik: Btw my chatGPT file is totally broken. I went back in commit history and I saw that Juan reverted some commits 3 weeks ago and deleted a bunch of stuff, including my chatGPT changes and some Meeting Logs. Did you do it by accident, @447452833836 ? If yes, did GitHub notify you of merge errors?
02/12/2023, 21:02 - EthanT: It was potentially this commit we discussed earlier, a revert. It didn't seem too impactful, only a few name changes. We have access to the code on git, so its an easy fix
02/12/2023, 21:03 - Juan: Hey Nikola, I can see that these problems are arising from when I reverted some changes because I was having compilation problems after pulling from main to my branch. I thought that I was just reverting my branch but it looks like I reverted all the others. I'm sorry about this 🙏🏽
02/12/2023, 21:10 - Juan: Yes, that one and these two contain the code that was reverted:
02/12/2023, 21:10 - Juan: https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/nk465/comp6000_groupproject/-/commit/00413b9580f2d514a98e2bb1f39299553f712c9f
02/12/2023, 21:11 - Juan: https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/nk465/comp6000_groupproject/-/commit/8d4815461d1c79b73e71725b3e1019fd97026498
02/12/2023, 21:11 - EthanT: Since we have access to the original code, it wont take long to get it reverted. Im getting the settings page working this weekend, but I can do it if need be
02/12/2023, 21:27 - EthanT: In a commit im adding now to get a navigation bar working, some of the clours break as I modify the themes file, ill get it fixed later
04/12/2023, 09:01 - Nik: Nw
04/12/2023, 09:26 - Misha: Hey guys do we know if we want to move the meeting so Nik can join or have it today anyway?
04/12/2023, 09:39 - Nik: It is iok if you keep it, nw
09/12/2023, 21:41 - +44 7856 791314 left
11/12/2023, 10:54 - Misha: Hey guys, I can't make it today unfortunately as I have an assignment due today and 2 presentations tomorrow, gotta get that done sorry! I will upload my changes on gitlab as well
11/12/2023, 10:57 - EthanT: No worries! Thanks for letting us know
11/12/2023, 13:29 - Juan: Hey guys, I couldn't make it today because I was at the GP today. I will have a look at what was discussed on gitlab
11/12/2023, 13:31 - Manuel Montero: we discussed GTA 6
11/12/2023, 13:33 - Juan: Hahahaha thanks for letting me know
11/12/2023, 13:34 - Juan: I thought the trailer looked amazing btw
11/12/2023, 13:34 - Manuel Montero: so Miami
11/12/2023, 13:35 - Juan: Yes lots of chaos
16/12/2023, 16:51 - Nik: Hey, Juan, I noticed a lot of commented out code in the login xml. Do you need it, or may I delete it?
16/12/2023, 16:51 - Nik: Btw I am currently implementing the change we were discussing about having the registration button in the login page (Discord like)
16/12/2023, 16:52 - Nik: <Media omitted>
16/12/2023, 17:18 - EthanT: Sounds good
16/12/2023, 17:37 - Nik: We need to create a local db to be used when accessing the app offline. Do you all agree?\
16/12/2023, 17:42 - Nik: Also, when I migrated the proj to my comp, it changed 3 files. I just committed the changes, but named the commit with capital letters to spot it easily. If needed (if it breaks the proj on your laptops), tell me, and I will revert it.
16/12/2023, 17:44 - EthanT: I'm grabbing the files now to do some work, I'll check when I do
16/12/2023, 17:55 - Nik: 👍
16/12/2023, 18:46 - Juan: Hey Nikola, don't worry I will delete it tomorrow
16/12/2023, 18:59 - Nik: Nw, I just wanted to know if you needed anything from them 😁
16/12/2023, 19:07 - Juan: Yh it was just code that I was using for some tests but don't think I will be needing it any more 👍🏼
16/12/2023, 19:09 - EthanT: Also Nik, one the changes IntelliJ made breaks the code, one of the ones that checks if a user exists. ill revert it back to the original for now in my next commit and figure out why it wasn't working after
16/12/2023, 19:10 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
16/12/2023, 19:10 - Nik: Are you sure it is this one?
16/12/2023, 19:10 - Nik: Try reversing it, but imo they are the same
16/12/2023, 19:14 - EthanT: It was the only line I changed, ill try it again
16/12/2023, 19:17 - EthanT: Can confirm
17/12/2023, 14:21 - EthanT: Just changed a few things in the database. Weight and height have been changed to TEXT to allow for the weight to be added.
18/12/2023, 00:49 - EthanT: Uploaded a big commit, when data is added to database, weight and height have they appropriate units added as well. Data control in settings works fully, just need to format
18/12/2023, 12:57 - EthanT: Is anyone joining the meeting online
18/12/2023, 12:58 - Misha: I didn’t know it was happening today, I’m on the train at the moment 😭
18/12/2023, 13:13 - EthanT: All good, I forgot about it as well 😅
19/12/2023, 16:17 - EthanT: Settings page is almost done, just need to format one of the fragments. I haven't added the code for deleting a user since it needs access to workout history.
20/12/2023, 13:08 - Nik: Hey, guys, do you know how I can contact Sergey except from the email, because he doesn't seem to respond to it.
20/12/2023, 13:15 - Nik: And except for microsoft teams?
20/12/2023, 13:35 - EthanT: Not that I know of, no
22/12/2023, 16:41 - EthanT: Hey all, hope everyone is enjoying themselves.

Just out of interest, are people available for a meeting next Friday for a catch up on the project and discussion for the next steps?
22/12/2023, 16:50 - Juan: I can 👍🏼
22/12/2023, 16:50 - Misha: Definitely can do a meeting
28/12/2023, 19:00 - EthanT: Everyone still good for a meeting tomorrow?

29/12/2023, 11:46 - Manuel Montero: sounds good! I’ll need to leave at 12:50 or so since I gotta shower haha
29/12/2023, 11:46 - EthanT: All good, shouldn't take too long, just a catch up on thr project and organising who's doing what for thr next stage
29/12/2023, 12:10 - Nik: Hey
29/12/2023, 12:10 - Nik: I won’t be able to join at 14:50
29/12/2023, 12:10 - Nik: *12:50
29/12/2023, 12:11 - Nik: Sorry about that
29/12/2023, 12:11 - Nik: I will prepare a summary message for you all, however
29/12/2023, 12:11 - Nik: To send in the gc
29/12/2023, 12:11 - Nik: Later
29/12/2023, 12:12 - EthanT: we're doing it now I presume
29/12/2023, 12:12 - Misha: No prob
29/12/2023, 12:12 - Misha: Where shall we call
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Nik: Oh
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Nik: So it’s not 12:50
29/12/2023, 12:13 - EthanT: WhatsApp?
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Nik: I will join the
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Nik: *the
29/12/2023, 12:13 - EthanT: No we just need to finish by then
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Nik: **then
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Misha: yeah
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Juan: Cool
29/12/2023, 12:13 - EthanT: null
29/12/2023, 12:13 - Juan: null
29/12/2023, 12:16 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
29/12/2023, 12:40 - EthanT: Forgot to mention, android studio had a major update to Android studio "hedgehog" not "giraffe", the project may not fully work in the old version so Id recommend downloading the new version
05/01/2024, 13:23 - Nik: They did have a big update, yeah
05/01/2024, 13:23 - Nik: I downloaded the new version
05/01/2024, 13:24 - Nik: Did you all do that as well :)
05/01/2024, 13:28 - Misha: Yes downloaded it
05/01/2024, 19:00 - Nik: Great :)
15/01/2024, 09:48 - EthanT: I'll be in Kennedy slightly early
15/01/2024, 10:58 - Juan: Are you in Kennedy right now?
15/01/2024, 10:59 - EthanT: I'll be leaving soon, I'm in the library rn
15/01/2024, 11:46 - EthanT: Is anyone going Kennedy at 1?
15/01/2024, 11:50 - Nik: I am in Keynes rn
15/01/2024, 11:50 - Nik: But I’ll go home to work on the assignments that are due 16th and 17th
15/01/2024, 11:51 - Nik: Kinda stressing over them rn, ngl
15/01/2024, 11:52 - EthanT: We can delay the meeting to Friday if need be
15/01/2024, 11:54 - Nik: Honestly, that would work better for me, I am really not sure how I am going to get the assignments done
15/01/2024, 11:55 - EthanT: All good, you still have time. I'll go to Kennedy and if I see Sergey, I'll update him
15/01/2024, 11:55 - Misha: Got CNN due in very soon so working on that, Friday or whenever sounds much better
15/01/2024, 12:50 - EthanT: Ive got a visualiser for exercises / workotus working and set as a separate function so it can be used multiple times. Ill show how to call it at some point
16/01/2024, 18:06 - EthanT: Code split for workout / exerices is done, most of the visual create is done in one file whilst some calls and declearations of what additional content such as buttons / text are defined in the original file. Still over 100 lines but from 400, its not aweful. Still need to move some stuff around buts its good enough for calls to it to be made
18/01/2024, 15:56 - EthanT: Is everyone still good for a meeting tomorrow?
18/01/2024, 17:07 - Misha: I am good for evening tomorrow
18/01/2024, 18:56 - Nik: I have a Quantum Comp lecture between 2 and 4
18/01/2024, 18:56 - Nik: May we do it before that?
18/01/2024, 18:57 - EthanT: I have that as well. Are you not free afterwards?
18/01/2024, 19:51 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
18/01/2024, 22:59 - Juan: Tomorrow I can do any time except between 11-12
18/01/2024, 23:00 - Juan: I can do any of those days
19/01/2024, 11:18 - EthanT: I'm going to be at library for a few hours if people want to join
19/01/2024, 11:19 - Nik: We can do afterwards
19/01/2024, 11:20 - Nik: Sergey is not available though
19/01/2024, 11:20 - Nik: I am for Monday 12 to 13
19/01/2024, 11:20 - Nik: How does that sound to you all?
19/01/2024, 11:22 - EthanT: Cool with me

19/01/2024, 11:49 - Nik: I am just going to the gym after the lecture
19/01/2024, 11:50 - Nik: So if we are meeting, I’ll come to the meeting and then go to the gym.
19/01/2024, 11:50 - EthanT: Cool with me
19/01/2024, 11:50 - Nik: Just let’s see if @447452833836, @447753129330, and @447985120259 are available today at 16:00

19/01/2024, 12:07 - Misha: Yeah I’m good for both
19/01/2024, 12:09 - Misha: Actually for today, any chance we could do it at 3?
19/01/2024, 12:09 - EthanT: Me and Nik have a lecture 2 - 4
19/01/2024, 12:10 - Nik: 3 is not possible for me and Ethan

20/01/2024, 20:41 - Nik: Like at 11? Or something like that?
20/01/2024, 20:44 - EthanT: I'm good whenever, I'll probably be training in the evenings so 11 is perfect for me
20/01/2024, 20:44 - EthanT: I also got a friend of mine to test the app, gave some feedback I'll go over tomorrow
20/01/2024, 21:53 - Misha: Tomorrow is tough for me, I’m free all day on Monday though
21/01/2024, 09:26 - Nik: I am running a bit late, maybe 11:30?

21/01/2024, 10:56 - Nik: Honestly it looks more like 12 rn
21/01/2024, 10:56 - Nik: I am running late
21/01/2024, 11:45 - Manuel Montero: I just woke uo 😭
21/01/2024, 11:52 - Nik: Are you coming to the library though?

21/01/2024, 12:10 - EthanT: Just grabbing food

21/01/2024, 12:34 - Manuel Montero: where are yall?
21/01/2024, 12:34 - EthanT: Enter library through main and go right, we're at thr back area of the right section
21/01/2024, 12:40 - Juan: I'm on my way guys
22/01/2024, 18:03 - Nik: Guys
22/01/2024, 18:03 - Nik: I totally forgot about the meeting today
22/01/2024, 18:45 - Nik: How is cognitive robotics, guys @447514583905 @447753129330
23/01/2024, 10:56 - EthanT: Not bad so far
24/01/2024, 13:39 - Nik: Are you at the lecture btw
24/01/2024, 13:40 - EthanT: Solving Problems data text, yh
24/01/2024, 13:40 - Nik: Oops, I wanted to ask you on private
27/01/2024, 10:39 - Nik: I'm going to work on the proj a bit
27/01/2024, 11:10 - EthanT: I'll get some UI improvements done later
27/01/2024, 13:01 - Nik: Good
27/01/2024, 13:01 - Nik: I did some changes to the local db, but I made some stupid mistakes
27/01/2024, 13:02 - Nik: I created 3 DBs instead of a single DB with 3 tables. I will fix that, but not now. Hopefully I can find some time to do it tonight or tomorrow.
27/01/2024, 13:02 - Nik: I am not merging my finaly branch with main yet, because the local DB is not finalized. I will merge it when I clear the errors.
27/01/2024, 13:03 - EthanT: Thats fair
27/01/2024, 19:40 - Nik: Hey, all. Dealing with the Local DB turned out to be harder than expected, but I think I finally got it to work. At least it doesn't break anymore. It might have some minor errors here and there, but nothing major. I currently print the IDs of the elements in the local db to the console. I am yet to figure out how to print the values in the app, but that's work for another day. I am comitting now. Have a nice evening, all.
27/01/2024, 19:42 - EthanT: Perfect! I'll check the code tomorrow, but good job today. Ill be in the library tomorrow getting some work done on performance and UI if anyone wants to join
27/01/2024, 19:43 - Nik: I may join, but I am not sure yet. Pls text when you are there, to remind me :)
27/01/2024, 19:48 - EthanT: will do 👍 Was going to get some work done today but I got home late last night 🥲
27/01/2024, 20:12 - Nik: nw
28/01/2024, 12:57 - EthanT: I'm on my way to the library now
28/01/2024, 16:04 - EthanT: I've got some prompt engineering done, seems consistent and I've got thr formatting done.

I've also started workout on thr conversion: when a workout is generated using gpt, its a JSON that needs ti be concerted and created in the dB, including the individual exercises. I've got somecode that works but it's the pairing that will be the tough part
28/01/2024, 17:32 - EthanT: Pairing is done now
28/01/2024, 17:58 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
28/01/2024, 19:35 - EthanT: We still good  for meeting at 12 tomorrow
28/01/2024, 19:54 - Nik: Sorry that I couldn’t join you today, mate
28/01/2024, 19:56 - Nik: Sounds amazing. Did you do the prompt engineering unsung the in-project function, that connects to the chatGPT API, or did you use the chatGPT online GUI?
28/01/2024, 19:57 - Nik: If you did the latter one, tomorrow I can try to recreate it in the app, using your engineered prompts.
28/01/2024, 19:57 - Nik: Maybe write them down and commit them as a text file to the Documents directory.
28/01/2024, 19:57 - EthanT: Yee I did this, assuming the api is the one I used over Winter, it's pretty easy to do this
28/01/2024, 19:58 - EthanT: I haven't had time to look at the gpt file, I'll look at it later to confirm
28/01/2024, 19:58 - EthanT: All good 👍
28/01/2024, 19:59 - Nik: <Media omitted>
28/01/2024, 20:03 - You changed this group's icon
29/01/2024, 11:25 - EthanT: I'm grabbing some food now, may be 5 min late
29/01/2024, 11:32 - Nik: Ok, I am in a lecture, but I should be on time
29/01/2024, 11:38 - Juan: I will be arriving a few minutes late
29/01/2024, 11:54 - Nik: I am on my way
29/01/2024, 11:55 - EthanT: I'm finishing now
29/01/2024, 11:58 - EthanT: Ive just looked over the GPT file, it can be integrated with the prompts easily
29/01/2024, 11:59 - Nik: That’s how I intended it to be
29/01/2024, 11:59 - Nik: But I’ve never actually done it
29/01/2024, 11:59 - Misha: Yeah it’s pretty easy to use had a look at it as well
29/01/2024, 12:00 - Misha: We should have enough tokens to use it for a while right @359882808200 ?
29/01/2024, 12:00 - Manuel Montero: I’m here I feel so ill 🫡
29/01/2024, 12:01 - EthanT: It's the same as I did over Christmas takes time to get back thi
29/01/2024, 12:01 - EthanT: Omw
04/02/2024, 17:57 - Nik: We are meeting tomorrow, correct?
04/02/2024, 17:57 - EthanT: Indeed
04/02/2024, 17:57 - Nik: I may do some sketching of the poster later tonight
04/02/2024, 17:58 - EthanT: Perfect. I'm doing some remodeling of a few pages this week
04/02/2024, 22:28 - Nik: Btw @447753129330, @447985120259, you guys havent merged your branches with main for 5-6 commits now
04/02/2024, 22:28 - Nik: Is that on purpose, or did you just forget to do that?
04/02/2024, 22:29 - Misha: On purpose, I haven't finished my functionality yet but will finish it soon
04/02/2024, 22:29 - Manuel Montero: I have been working on the SQL mostly so I haven’t been merging as regularly but since I’ll be working on the history page now I’ll be more onto it
04/02/2024, 22:29 - Nik: because there is a posibility of merge conflicts or code issues if you don't merge for a long period of time
04/02/2024, 22:29 - Nik: I see. Still, I would suggest to try and merge every week or two :)
04/02/2024, 22:30 - Manuel Montero: I thought I merged on Tuesday but maybe I did it wrong
04/02/2024, 22:30 - EthanT: I can help check the merges after the meeting tomorrow
04/02/2024, 22:30 - Nik: We can check it tomorrow, if you want
04/02/2024, 22:31 - Manuel Montero: Yeah!
04/02/2024, 22:33 - Nik: Btw may you take a look at this poster
04/02/2024, 22:34 - Nik: <Media omitted>
04/02/2024, 22:34 - Manuel Montero: I like it!
04/02/2024, 22:34 - Nik: This is an A3 Poster template from canva
04/02/2024, 22:35 - EthanT: Seems pretty good
04/02/2024, 22:35 - Nik: I like it too ❤️
04/02/2024, 22:35 - Nik: Ok, then, I will start filling it in
04/02/2024, 22:36 - Nik: And throughout the week we can continue working on it
04/02/2024, 22:36 - EthanT: Sounds good
05/02/2024, 07:48 - Misha: Hey guys I've made more commits on my own branch, revamped the ai page a little (not finished yet), need to work on linking it to the main pages. Also managed to take some input from the user and will be able to feed it in as string input for GPT.  Need to work on getting another page for more info for the user to be able to enter.
05/02/2024, 07:49 - Misha: I would hope to join you guys at 12 on call if that's okay, hopefully I'll wake up, need a nap 😅 Speak soon guys
05/02/2024, 09:12 - EthanT: Perfect, we can go over it during / after the meeting
05/02/2024, 11:58 - Nik: On my way
05/02/2024, 16:34 - EthanT: Currently working on remodelling the settings page, but its going to take me a while to do, way underestimated how much I need to change, ill try keep the changes to my branch for now since it doesn't interfere with other pages
05/02/2024, 16:55 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
07/02/2024, 18:11 - Nik: This looks way cleaner. Last one was a bit cluttered. Good job, Ethan.
07/02/2024, 18:12 - Nik: I will open canva to work on the poster a bit. I remember Manu told me that he is loged into canva with his uni email. What about the rest of you?
07/02/2024, 18:13 - EthanT: I'll can check tomorrow
07/02/2024, 18:13 - Misha: I can try the uni email, should work
07/02/2024, 18:19 - Nik: <Media omitted>
07/02/2024, 18:20 - Nik: We have to get a new key and add it to Git ignore probably
07/02/2024, 18:20 - Nik: Tell me when you have an account :)
07/02/2024, 19:40 - Nik: <Media omitted>
07/02/2024, 19:49 - Nik: <Media omitted>
07/02/2024, 19:50 - Nik: I think that two smaller photos and some icons can fit already, but the text can (and probably should) be shortend even more.
07/02/2024, 21:30 - Nik: Hey, all. I just realized, that I am coming back from Barcelona on Monday in the afternoon. I will not be able to attend our weekly meeting with Sergey that way. Are you ok if we move the meeting to Tuesday, maybe?
07/02/2024, 21:30 - Manuel Montero: Oh yeah I forgot I had an physio appointment at 1pm so it’s best on Tuesday for me
07/02/2024, 21:32 - Nik: What time on Tuesday suits you? I can do from 10, from 11, or after 13 (I have a lecture between 9 and 10 and then between 12 and 13).
07/02/2024, 21:32 - Nik: What about the rest of you?
08/02/2024, 09:08 - Juan: On Tuesday I can between 3 and 4pm
08/02/2024, 09:38 - Nik: We can do it then, If everyone is ok?
08/02/2024, 11:42 - EthanT: Cool with me
08/02/2024, 11:43 - Nik: Misha is also good with that, I just spoke to him.
08/02/2024, 11:43 - Nik: I can text Sergey if you want?
08/02/2024, 11:43 - EthanT: Sounds good
08/02/2024, 12:07 - Nik: I emailed him
10/02/2024, 23:52 - EthanT: Just going over the data stored in the database and thought of a few potential changes:

- Duration currently hasn't got anything assigned to it. The average workout is not more 2 hours so we can say that its in seconds
- Target can also be changed to be more specific
- Difficulty also has been changed but we have discussed this
11/02/2024, 20:43 - EthanT: Also, ill be in Kennedy at 12 just so if Sergey is there ill catch him up with the progress. you can join if you want
11/02/2024, 20:51 - Misha: Sounds good I might come around
13/02/2024, 00:04 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
13/02/2024, 00:05 - EthanT: Im cool with any of these times
13/02/2024, 00:05 - Misha: 12-1 is good with me
13/02/2024, 02:03 - Misha: If its not too late I just remembered I have a lec at that time but nothing at 5
13/02/2024, 02:03 - Misha: So 5 will be better
13/02/2024, 02:03 - Misha: If everyone else is good with that
13/02/2024, 21:26 - Nik: Did you meet with Sergey today?
13/02/2024, 21:27 - EthanT: Not today, no
13/02/2024, 21:34 - EthanT: I've been ill for the past few days, and some changes today broke the search workouts
13/02/2024, 21:35 - EthanT: Also, do we have someone doing the "create workout" page
13/02/2024, 21:35 - EthanT: I have some sketches for it I can finish
13/02/2024, 22:00 - Misha: Is that the create AI workout page?
13/02/2024, 22:02 - EthanT: No, if a user knows a workout they want but it doesn't exist, they can create it by adding a custom name, workout details and picking from exercises
13/02/2024, 22:04 - Misha: <Media omitted>
13/02/2024, 22:04 - Misha: i thought that was for my ai page
13/02/2024, 22:05 - Misha: or would the user click the "ai" button at the top?
13/02/2024, 22:08 - EthanT: That page allows the user to switch between picking the different options:

Manual search allows for the user to search the database for a workout 

Manual create allows for a user to create a custom workout

Ai uses ai to generate a workout
13/02/2024, 22:08 - EthanT: The page you showed just is a navigation page
13/02/2024, 22:08 - Misha: oh ok just because i linked the create button to my page
13/02/2024, 22:09 - Misha: havent commited it yet tho
13/02/2024, 22:09 - Misha: will try to commit in a few hours
13/02/2024, 22:11 - EthanT: If you go to the xml it should have gotoai
13/02/2024, 22:19 - EthanT: Do note that the page is currently broken
13/02/2024, 22:20 - Misha: Yeah I’m just focusing on doing my ai page and gpt so it’s ok
13/02/2024, 22:24 - Misha: also @447514583905 do you mind if I make some changes to the prompt? It'll allow for more specific workout as well as not giving the "unsure" option
13/02/2024, 22:24 - Misha: it won't be the biggest changes
13/02/2024, 22:25 - EthanT: Go for it. The unsure was designed for the system to re ask gpt if it doesn't get a response
13/02/2024, 22:25 - Misha: 👍
14/02/2024, 09:01 - Nik: Do you want to meet today at 12 and work together?
14/02/2024, 10:20 - Misha: I’ve made some progress gonna finish it off this evening
14/02/2024, 10:20 - Misha: Poster also added a few icons
14/02/2024, 10:31 - EthanT: Can do
14/02/2024, 10:35 - Nik: Great
14/02/2024, 10:36 - Nik: Anyone else?
14/02/2024, 11:02 - Manuel Montero: I want to but I’m still infected with Covid 😔☹️
14/02/2024, 11:50 - Nik: I see
14/02/2024, 11:50 - Nik: Nw

15/02/2024, 12:02 - Nik: Good work
15/02/2024, 12:02 - Nik: Nice
15/02/2024, 12:02 - Nik: This is urgent
15/02/2024, 12:03 - Nik: However, I am a bit busy today
15/02/2024, 12:03 - Nik: <Media omitted>
15/02/2024, 12:03 - Nik: I wanted to maybe meet and discuss it, but ai don’t know if I can make it.
15/02/2024, 12:04 - Nik: Juan, did you manage to work on the poster the other day?
15/02/2024, 12:05 - Nik: I may try and write an abstract later, but it can happen tonight the earliest.
15/02/2024, 12:11 - EthanT: I can get an account for canvas (the software for the poster) and get that done, and work on the abstract after the seminar as well
15/02/2024, 12:12 - Nik: Ok, let me know if you do that, so that I share the poster with you.
15/02/2024, 12:13 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
15/02/2024, 12:22 - Nik: Yes 👍
15/02/2024, 12:22 - Nik: @447753129330 , you still haven’t accepted the invitation btw

15/02/2024, 12:26 - EthanT: Is the plan to replace the background symbols with the logos of apps weve used?
15/02/2024, 12:47 - Nik: Yes
15/02/2024, 12:47 - Nik: That’s what Misha suggested. I think that it is a good idea
15/02/2024, 13:07 - Juan: I didn't have time yesterday because I had to do work for one of my modules but I can work on it right now
15/02/2024, 13:58 - Manuel Montero: Sorry this week has pretty much been sleeping and taking pills 😭
15/02/2024, 14:01 - Juan: Is any one gonna be at the library today in case you wanna go over it together?
15/02/2024, 14:02 - Nik: Probably not, but I am not sure. I’ll text you if I go there.
15/02/2024, 14:04 - Juan: 👍🏼
16/02/2024, 01:41 - Nik: I just finished working for today and I couldn't get to the project. Sorry, guys. I will try to prioritize it tomorrow. It is the deadline after all. Good night, lads.
16/02/2024, 06:46 - Misha: this is a brief outline I have made for the abstract if anyone wants to follow it, I'll also try to write something:

1. Introduction (30 words)
 Briefly introduce our app and its main objective.
2. Methodology (40 words):
Briefly describe the key technologies and methods we used.
mention specific tools or frameworks.

3. Results (50 words):
Highlight the key achievements and outcomes of our project.
Mention any significant metrics or improvements achieved.

4. Conclusion (30 words):
Summarise the impact and significance of your project.
Briefly mention future directions or potential applications.

this is just a simple outline if anyone wants to write anything
16/02/2024, 09:55 - EthanT: Pretty sure the template days just intro amd results
16/02/2024, 09:56 - Misha: I meant that’s the template for the intro
16/02/2024, 09:57 - EthanT: Ok
16/02/2024, 09:57 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
16/02/2024, 09:57 - Misha: Yeah it’s up to you, you don’t have to use it
16/02/2024, 09:58 - EthanT: This is on. Moodle. Irlt says we need to follow the template
16/02/2024, 09:59 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
16/02/2024, 09:59 - Misha: Oh fairs
16/02/2024, 09:59 - Misha: Nevermind then
16/02/2024, 10:00 - EthanT: I presumed that this means we can't change titles, I can check previous ones
16/02/2024, 10:01 - EthanT: https://moodle.kent.ac.uk/2023/mod/resource/view.php?id=69509
16/02/2024, 11:31 - EthanT: I'm also getting the manual "create workout" done this weekend or an outline at least
16/02/2024, 13:06 - Nik: Did anyone write this?
16/02/2024, 13:06 - Nik: I have some seminars and labs rn
16/02/2024, 13:06 - Nik: <Media omitted>
16/02/2024, 13:06 - Nik: If no one has done it, I will go to the library at 15:00 and write the abstract
16/02/2024, 14:17 - Misha: I am studying for a quiz that’s due today so in a couple of hours will be able to write it as well
16/02/2024, 16:50 - Nik: I am at the library rn
16/02/2024, 16:50 - Nik: I am writing the abstract
16/02/2024, 16:51 - Nik: Do we have a project name? Health App with Generative AI Features?
16/02/2024, 17:00 - EthanT: Workout Assistant?
16/02/2024, 17:05 - Nik: We can call it like that
16/02/2024, 17:05 - Nik: I will change it on the poster as well
16/02/2024, 17:48 - Nik: I wrote a project description which sounds pretty good, imo
16/02/2024, 17:48 - Nik: Our Workout Assistant App is a privacy-centered fitness platform that utilized generative AI to deliver personalized workout experiences. In response to growing concerns about privacy and data security, we have integrated an Anonymous mode, allowing users to access a diverse collection of pre-defined workouts without the need for logging in or sharing personal data. On the other side, for those seeking tailored fitness regimens more than privacy, our AI Workout Generation feature (which can be accessed through the normal mode, not the anonymous mode) provides customized routines based on individual goals, fitness levels, and available equipment. However, even in the normal mode we collect minimal user data and allow people at any time within a few clicks to delete even the small amount of data we’ve collected for them. By prioritizing user privacy and offering personalized fitness solutions, our app caters to a wide range of preferences and needs within the modern fitness community.
16/02/2024, 17:49 - Nik: It is also almost exactly 150 words. It is 154. I will refine it a bit more rn.
16/02/2024, 17:51 - EthanT: One thing maybe to add if there's space is how it stil runs as a normal health app. Whilst it does have ai features that are penjoycentered, it's still operates as a health app with all the comfort features that users use and enjory
16/02/2024, 17:51 - Nik: I will try to squeeze that in
16/02/2024, 17:55 - EthanT: Just because otherwise if thr user feels like the app just generate a workout, people may feel its just a glorified Gpt input, whereas explaining its still a workout app, shows its a tru combination of the
16/02/2024, 18:00 - Nik: Btw regarding the poster - I've just uploaded the current final draft to the Documents directory (inside the Poster and Abstract folder). Honestly, it is looking quite good, imo. I suggest that you all take a look at it now and say if you are happy with it or not.
16/02/2024, 18:05 - EthanT: Seems good to me. Maybe add instead of the abstract, instead on the poster how it still works as a normal workout app. Also we're we going replace the rocket etc with the icons of programs we used
16/02/2024, 18:14 - Nik: I've uploaded both versions, so that we can decide which one to submit.
16/02/2024, 18:14 - Nik: <Media omitted>
16/02/2024, 18:14 - Nik: <Media omitted>
16/02/2024, 18:25 - Nik: I made slight improvements to the project description. I shortened it a bit, clarified a bit better the data deletion section, and added that we show visuals of the exercises and have a neat GUI to show that our app is not a glorified chatGPT input.
16/02/2024, 18:25 - Nik: This is the final version :)
16/02/2024, 18:25 - Nik: Our Workout Assistant App is a privacy-centered fitness platform that utilized generative AI to deliver personalized workout experiences. In response to growing concerns about privacy and data security, we have integrated an Anonymous mode, allowing users to access a diverse collection of pre-defined workouts without the need for logging in or sharing personal data.

In our standard mode, we collect minimal user data, which users can easily delete with just a few clicks. With a user-friendly interface, visuals of each exercise in the routine, privacy in mind, and personalized fitness solutions, our app caters to the diverse needs of the modern fitness community. (142 words)
16/02/2024, 18:26 - EthanT: Sounds perfect
16/02/2024, 18:26 - EthanT: Yh, it seems the symbols get covered. I just feel the rockets aren't exactly relevant
16/02/2024, 18:27 - Nik: I see your point
16/02/2024, 18:28 - Juan: Amazing 👏
16/02/2024, 18:29 - Juan: What if we remove the symbols?
16/02/2024, 18:30 - Juan: Because it doesn't make sense to have the icons around sense we already placed them at the bottom
16/02/2024, 18:30 - Juan: Since*
16/02/2024, 18:35 - Nik: In the first version I left the science icons, because I didn't want to duplicate them. However, Ethan made the point that the science icons are not relevant to our project, so I changed them with the icons of the tools we used. I don't want to remove the "Built with" section, because I think that it is more structured with it.
16/02/2024, 18:36 - Juan: Oh no I mean just removing the icons that are around
16/02/2024, 18:36 - EthanT: Could we maybe change them to workout symbols?
16/02/2024, 18:36 - EthanT: Like dumbells etc
16/02/2024, 18:36 - Juan: That would be a great idea
16/02/2024, 18:37 - Juan: I have created a new page on cava without the symbols
16/02/2024, 18:39 - Juan: The amongus characters look great Nik 🤣🤣
16/02/2024, 18:39 - Nik: <Media omitted>
16/02/2024, 18:39 - Nik: Just added him hahaha
16/02/2024, 18:39 - Juan: Perfect
16/02/2024, 18:40 - Nik: I read someone jokingly suggesting that in the GC and I think that it is brilliant 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
16/02/2024, 18:42 - Nik: Honestly, thats a good idea. @447452833836, may you search for some non-premium colorful fitness icons on canva or upload some png files from the internet and positiont them similarly to the initial icons, please? In that time I will work on the Results section in the abstract.
16/02/2024, 18:43 - Juan: 👍🏼
16/02/2024, 19:31 - Nik: I am almost done with the results section
16/02/2024, 19:55 - Nik: Done
16/02/2024, 19:55 - Nik: Our project aims to develop an android workout application with a focus on privacy and personalized workout generation. It includes an Anonymous mode for privacy-conscious users and a normal mode with additional ChatGPT-powered personalized workout generation functionality. Utilizing Android Studio and Java – the official IDE and the most used language for android application development, we designed a user-friendly home page featuring an Anonymous Browsing button to emphasize incognito usage. When one enters anonymously, he gains access to a prepopulated SQLite Database with various workouts to suit anyone’s fitness needs. On the other hand, when one logs in normally, we implemented TiDB's online database for secure user authentication. Finally, upon logging in, users can utilize various functionalities, including an AI workout generator powered by ChatGPT's API. All they must do to receive a custom workout based on their preferences and goals is to answer a brief questionary.
16/02/2024, 19:57 - Nik: It is 146 words. It was 230 words initially, because I tried explaining everything in detail. I tried trimming it, but it was impossible, so I changed it, so that most functionality is just mentioned.
16/02/2024, 19:58 - Nik: If you do not have any suggestions, I will pass both paragraphs through Grammarly and then we can submit the poster and the abstract.
16/02/2024, 20:11 - EthanT: Seems perfect to me
Remember I think we're marked on out performance in person, so we can explain more of the detail there
16/02/2024, 20:14 - Nik: True
16/02/2024, 20:14 - Nik: Ok then
16/02/2024, 20:15 - Nik: I checked with grammarly and formatted. I am going to upload everything to git when I get home from the library and I will then submit to moodle.
16/02/2024, 20:15 - Nik: How should I submit it to moodle btw? I don't even know if it is not in raptor, because Marek prefers raptor. Please send me instructions :)
16/02/2024, 20:18 - EthanT: https://moodle.kent.ac.uk/2023/mod/resource/view.php?id=69377
16/02/2024, 20:18 - EthanT: Seems it is raptor
16/02/2024, 21:43 - Nik: I’ll submit after 15 mins
16/02/2024, 21:43 - Nik: Just wanted to have dinner
16/02/2024, 22:00 - Nik: Both the poster and abstract final versions are committed to git and uploaded to raptor
16/02/2024, 22:05 - Nik: I hope that this is the only place we are supposed to submit at. Have a good night, guys.
16/02/2024, 22:08 - EthanT: And you mate, great work today getting that done! Appolgies i havent helped alot with it. I actually slept last night finally, and have felt much better. I'll get the last workout page we need to make finished this weekend!
18/02/2024, 10:31 - Nik: Guys, I’ll try and do some work on the project today
18/02/2024, 10:32 - Nik: Would it be possible that you committed and bigger uncommitted changes you have on your local branches?
18/02/2024, 13:58 - EthanT: wdym
18/02/2024, 17:45 - Nik: *any
18/02/2024, 17:45 - Nik: Would it be possible that you committed any bigger uncommitted changes you have on your local branches?
18/02/2024, 17:45 - Nik: To merge with main, essentially
18/02/2024, 17:55 - EthanT: I have some big commits on my branch but their with a new create workout page.
18/02/2024, 18:40 - Nik: btw the app is totally broken on my machine rn. It wouldn't even run. <This message was edited>
18/02/2024, 18:40 - Nik: This message was deleted
18/02/2024, 18:40 - EthanT: I assume from the main branch?
18/02/2024, 18:40 - Nik: yeah
18/02/2024, 18:41 - EthanT: Let me push my commit then I'll check
18/02/2024, 18:41 - Nik: Ok, waiting :)
18/02/2024, 18:43 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 18:48 - EthanT: Is there an exception or anything?
18/02/2024, 18:51 - Nik: I will try to run it again
18/02/2024, 18:52 - Nik: I just restarted Android Studio for the second time (to make sure that there is no bug with the IDE)
18/02/2024, 18:53 - EthanT: is it the app thats crashing or the emulator? do you see the emulated device
18/02/2024, 18:54 - Nik: no, emulator is fine
18/02/2024, 18:54 - Nik: it is the app
18/02/2024, 18:54 - Nik: this is the error
18/02/2024, 18:54 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 18:54 - Nik: And here is the emulator
18/02/2024, 18:54 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 18:55 - Nik: Basically nothing happens and on the bottom it says "Terminating the app" and doesn't change:
18/02/2024, 18:55 - EthanT: Strange, when was it working last
18/02/2024, 18:55 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 18:55 - Nik: It was working last time I worked on the proj
18/02/2024, 18:56 - Nik: Then I just logged in today, downloaded most recent committs from main and that happened
18/02/2024, 18:56 - EthanT: Only thing I could think of is there may have been an update to android studio itself that one of usinstalled, is there any updates in the notification area
18/02/2024, 18:56 - Nik: Btw you havent pushed your most recent changes to main, so rn we are working on two different versions
18/02/2024, 18:56 - Nik: I will try to pull from you to see if there is any difference
18/02/2024, 18:57 - EthanT: theres only one or 2 commits I belive for the functionality for the create workout, the basic file is in main
18/02/2024, 18:58 - Nik: Yes, there actually was some update to android studio or sth. It was in the notifications at the bottom right corner. I just clicked "Install", because I always do that and it usually doesn't break anything. Strange. Mayne it has something to do with it, idk.
18/02/2024, 18:59 - EthanT: I keep Android Studio fully up to date, I haven't a problem so far
18/02/2024, 19:00 - Nik: I'll google it to see if other's had the same issue
18/02/2024, 19:00 - EthanT: If not, I can try help fix it tomorrow when we meet
18/02/2024, 19:01 - EthanT: Have got the majority of workout creation done tho, just need to hook it up to the DB and do a few validation checks
18/02/2024, 19:05 - Nik: I found that it is probably not a bug with our app
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: The same bug happens when I launch the device as well
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: It, however, still launches
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: OR MAYBE IT IS A BIG WITH OUR APP
18/02/2024, 19:06 - EthanT: It works on my laptop and pc, still works on my phone as well. we can check tomorrow
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: Because I cannot see it on the device
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: strance
18/02/2024, 19:06 - Nik: *g
18/02/2024, 19:07 - EthanT: Have you tried a new emulator maybe
18/02/2024, 19:07 - Nik: I will still try to figure it out, but probably yeah
18/02/2024, 19:08 - Nik: I'll try the good ol' "delete and reinstall android studio" tehnique haha
18/02/2024, 19:09 - EthanT: Swear we had to do that at the start before we even began the project 🤣
18/02/2024, 19:09 - Nik: Yes, we did hahahahahahah
18/02/2024, 19:17 - Nik: Btw we never really started using Monday, did we?
18/02/2024, 19:18 - EthanT: No, we didnt actually...
18/02/2024, 19:24 - Nik: Just letting you know, that I have to intall a new device with the new Android studio. The new device comes with a new instance of android. Since I don't remember what we chose last time, I decided to go with Android Tiramisu, because I love Tiramisu <#
18/02/2024, 19:24 - Nik: *❤️
18/02/2024, 19:24 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 19:25 - Nik: I see...
18/02/2024, 19:26 - Nik: Weren't we supposed to use something though. I mean from the uni? I hope that it is not penalized.
18/02/2024, 19:27 - EthanT: Don't remember anything on the brief
18/02/2024, 19:27 - EthanT: Thought that was the point of using git to an extent
18/02/2024, 19:28 - Nik: Yeah, it makes sense, but I cannot be sure, since sometimes strange stuff is required.
18/02/2024, 19:28 - EthanT: Very true
18/02/2024, 19:30 - Nik: IT WORKED
18/02/2024, 19:30 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 19:30 - EthanT: 🥳🥳🥳
18/02/2024, 19:30 - Nik: Honestly, the restart tehnique is the most op thing in computing 😂😂
18/02/2024, 19:30 - EthanT: Annoyingly true
18/02/2024, 19:31 - Nik: Let's start working now haha
18/02/2024, 19:33 - EthanT: Other good news, just created a workout that now exists in the database using only the app: create workout is finished. User gives basic details like name, equipment, difficulty, before picking from a list of exercise. user then confirms this, and the workout is created successfully in the database.
18/02/2024, 19:33 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 19:35 - EthanT: Proccess isn't flawless. As of how the app cominutes with the DB, it has to effectively duplicate exercises, that will probably be the next thing I get done. It does link the pairs, was worried it wasn't going to work. theres also no validation for things like duration atm
18/02/2024, 19:38 - Nik: 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
18/02/2024, 19:38 - EthanT: Pushed it to main
18/02/2024, 19:40 - EthanT: Oh and it emphasises the issue of high id numbers in the db, up to 60001  i think now  🤣
18/02/2024, 19:58 - Nik: Does anyone know why when I click on the Begin button here the app doesn't see any click happening?
18/02/2024, 19:58 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 19:59 - Nik: Or am I the first one noticing that issue
18/02/2024, 19:59 - EthanT: Let me check
18/02/2024, 20:00 - EthanT: It never has, since I wasn't sure on thr page I never added thr code
18/02/2024, 20:00 - Nik: I added the page
18/02/2024, 20:00 - Nik: the page is workout_ai
18/02/2024, 20:00 - EthanT: Ah, I had that linked correctly, it's just there was no listner
18/02/2024, 20:00 - Nik: however, it still doesn't work. I added some print statements and they work for the other buttons, but not for that one
18/02/2024, 20:00 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 20:01 - EthanT: Let me check
18/02/2024, 20:01 - Nik: OHHHH
18/02/2024, 20:01 - Nik: I'll check if I can do that, I totally forgot that I need one
18/02/2024, 20:02 - EthanT: All good, I've had the issue so much lately with my pages
18/02/2024, 20:03 - EthanT: I've got it working, I can push if you want
18/02/2024, 20:03 - Nik: No need, I did it as well
18/02/2024, 20:03 - Nik: it is working :)
18/02/2024, 20:03 - EthanT: Perfect
18/02/2024, 20:03 - Nik: thank's for the suggestion
18/02/2024, 20:05 - EthanT: I need to do some remodeling of how the app adds stuff to the dB, so i can't hook the ai page to the dB so it adds a new workout, for a while
18/02/2024, 20:05 - EthanT: You can still get it generating and showing thr workout obviously
18/02/2024, 20:05 - Nik: I see
18/02/2024, 20:20 - EthanT: Shouldn't take too long to make, just needs a lot of testing
18/02/2024, 20:27 - Nik: I managed to connect the "Generate" button in the workout_ai java file with the ChatGPT_Client java file successfully. However some bug occurs when I actually try to connect to chatGPT.
18/02/2024, 20:27 - Nik: This is the error message: You didn't provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in an Authorization header using Bearer auth (i.e. Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY), or as the password field (with blank username) if you're accessing the API from your browser and are prompted for a username and password. You can obtain an API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
18/02/2024, 20:28 - Nik: I guess that there might be an issue with the key again. I will debug next week (unless I find tonight, but I doubt that). However, the important thing it that they are almost connect :)
18/02/2024, 20:29 - EthanT: I know Misha changed the key the other day, may he that
18/02/2024, 20:29 - EthanT: I'm omw back with food will check later
18/02/2024, 20:29 - Nik: I only have to fix that bug, then change the test prompt with the actual promt we've built (fed with the answers to the questions), and that should be it.
18/02/2024, 20:30 - Nik: Yeah, he did. I saw his committ and added the new key to the appropriate field in the ChatGPT Java file, but it still doesn't work, unfortuantelly.
18/02/2024, 20:59 - EthanT: The account is the Groups Google account I assume
18/02/2024, 21:43 - EthanT: Coudnt get the API working but duplicate exercise bug is fixed 👍
19/02/2024, 10:25 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
19/02/2024, 11:18 - Nik: 😊
19/02/2024, 11:18 - Nik: We are meeting with Sergey in 40 mins, right?
19/02/2024, 11:19 - EthanT: Indeed, I'm grabbing a late breakfast now
19/02/2024, 12:00 - Nik: @447452833836 , you here?
19/02/2024, 19:39 - Nik: I don't understand why it is "ChatGPT-based application" instead of "ChatGPT-based Workout Assistant" or "ChatGPT-based Health App". Do you think we can change it? I am debating whether to email Sergey to ask if he can change it somehow.
19/02/2024, 19:39 - EthanT: Can do
19/02/2024, 19:40 - Nik: Yeah, I will email him
20/02/2024, 20:43 - Nik: Guys, I have news. First, I fixed the "bug" with chatGPT. Second, I am extremely frustrated, because that was the stupidest "issue" possible...
20/02/2024, 20:43 - Nik: The error was that... drums... our free trial ended
20/02/2024, 20:43 - Misha: Tell us…
20/02/2024, 20:43 - Nik: That's was it...
20/02/2024, 20:43 - Misha: Fuck sakes
20/02/2024, 20:44 - Misha: Haha how stupid
20/02/2024, 20:44 - Nik: I paid some 5$ and now we can resume working :)
20/02/2024, 20:45 - Nik: Exactly! I've spent hours on that yesterday and today. I've changed the code so much and nothing worked, when the issue was that we just didn't have credit.
20/02/2024, 20:47 - Misha: Literally, I guess it’s something we’ll know about now 😂
20/02/2024, 20:47 - Misha: I can contribute to that btw Idm
20/02/2024, 20:50 - Nik: ❤️
20/02/2024, 20:50 - Nik: we can maybe split at the end of the year
20/02/2024, 20:50 - Nik: It's 12 pounds already
20/02/2024, 20:50 - Nik: because 5 + 1 tax
20/02/2024, 20:50 - Nik: and I did that twice
20/02/2024, 20:51 - Nik: but if we don't go over 15-20, I honestly don't mind
21/02/2024, 03:29 - Misha: Yeah that’s still okay it’s only fair on you
21/02/2024, 11:16 - Nik: I made some design improvements yesterday. Feel free to to criticize (but then also implement your suggestions 😉)
21/02/2024, 17:28 - Nik: Hey, all, I’ve continued working in design improvements. Yesterday I made changes to the Main, Login and Registration pages. Today I finished some stuff that I left yesterday and started working on the Home and Workout Options pages. I believe I have done some good things :) Hopefully you and others like it more that way.
21/02/2024, 17:28 - Nik: *working on
21/02/2024, 17:30 - EthanT: Just working on some parts as well. ive modified a few things, e.g. I changed the text to black and bold on the home page so its easy to see and changed the size of the "anononous" since it was too easy to click
21/02/2024, 17:30 - Nik: Search workout, Create workout, and AI workout are the next 3 pages I plan on focusing on. I may not be able to work on them tomorrow, but maybe I’ll find some time on Friday. During the weekend and on Monday and Tuesday I will not be very active, unfortunately, since with Asya we are going to visit a few friends of ours that are studying at the Netherlands.
21/02/2024, 17:31 - EthanT: Im also looking at remodelly search and create
21/02/2024, 17:32 - EthanT: Also adding some more animations to keep the app dynamic
21/02/2024, 17:33 - Nik: Good job, mate 👍. Pull my changes to see what I’ve done, to not do the same thing twice 😉. I also created this color “almost black”, because I think that in some situations it looks better than pure black. I also have “dark gray” which is a bit lighter than “almost black” and I’ve used for smaller text 😂
21/02/2024, 17:33 - Nik: That’s crucial for the smoothness feeling, nice
21/02/2024, 17:34 - Misha: Nice guys
21/02/2024, 17:34 - Misha: I’ll do my changes hopefully Friday and definitely the weekend
21/02/2024, 17:34 - Nik: Btw I also added these “complementary” and “complementary2”. Check them out :)
21/02/2024, 17:34 - EthanT: let me know and ill help get the code working for adding it to the db as well as showing the workout
21/02/2024, 17:35 - Nik: That would be great, if you do them, I will focus on other pages :)
21/02/2024, 17:55 - Nik: Btw I downloaded the Nike training app to get ideas for our app design. Their apps are quite aesthetic. Decided for yourself if you want to do that as well
21/02/2024, 17:56 - Nik: <Media omitted>
21/02/2024, 18:43 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
21/02/2024, 18:48 - Nik: Looks great honestly
21/02/2024, 20:01 - EthanT: Just pushed my changes for the evening, will continue tomorrow
22/02/2024, 20:28 - Nik: Hey, all! Today I added a global font and color. I also worked on the Create Workouts page to improve its design. I did some other smaller stuff, but these two are the major ones. That's it from me for today.
22/02/2024, 20:28 - Nik: @447753129330 , how are the scenarios going?
22/02/2024, 21:20 - Manuel Montero: I have done one, I am also working on the History Continued page! I am aiming to do another two scenarios tomorrow! How many do we need?
22/02/2024, 21:50 - EthanT: I had redesigned create workout as well 🤣
22/02/2024, 21:50 - EthanT: You deleted this message
22/02/2024, 21:52 - EthanT: 5? If there detailed enough and vary we won't need many
22/02/2024, 21:53 - Manuel Montero: I also thought of 5 detailed ones
22/02/2024, 21:54 - EthanT: Sounds perfect
22/02/2024, 21:58 - EthanT: A commit I done early enabled some code that disables certain parts of the app if its offline. I believe I fixed the issue I told you earlier @359882808200 where thr app freaks our if it hibernated. I do need to test it all though
22/02/2024, 22:38 - Nik: Great, upload them to the Documents folder :)
22/02/2024, 22:38 - Nik: No way…
22/02/2024, 22:39 - Nik: Btw I showed Asya our app and told her that we are open to suggestions
22/02/2024, 22:39 - Nik: She told me that she can help us create a better logo. I asked her if she can do it before the poster fair and she told me she’ll try to come up with a design to propose to us :)
22/02/2024, 22:40 - Nik: Great
22/02/2024, 22:40 - EthanT: Sounds amazing!
22/02/2024, 22:41 - Nik: If anyone has any requirements, we can tell them to get in the next few days 👍
22/02/2024, 22:43 - Nik: Btw she liked your colors way more than mine 😫😫
22/02/2024, 22:43 - Nik: The ones on the main page
22/02/2024, 22:43 - Nik: She loves them
22/02/2024, 22:43 - Nik: While she said that mine are not so cool 🥲
22/02/2024, 22:44 - Nik: Maybe we can try to put your colors instead and see how the app looks
22/02/2024, 22:44 - EthanT: I'll get some more animations crested tomorrow. I was able to get one working for the workouts page when you change manual / ai. Very satisfying to use
23/02/2024, 14:54 - EthanT: Just pushing a few minor visual improvements / bug fixes, including the workout option toggle not updating.
Im also pushing a change where the user can see their password when they login
23/02/2024, 17:05 - Nik: I will work for a few hours now as well
23/02/2024, 17:22 - Nik: Btw I did some major file renaming in the last few days, so PLEASE pull all changes from main before writing new code. Merge conflicts might emerge otherwise.
23/02/2024, 17:24 - EthanT: Already done 👍
23/02/2024, 17:39 - Nik: I tried something different with the colors btw. I will now change them across the entire app. This is not a final decision, but a proposition. However, Asya likes it a lot more that way. The color selection that I chose last year and we had until now was, in her opinion, too oldschool hahahaha. She said I am a pensioner 😂😂😂😂
23/02/2024, 18:47 - EthanT: I think aside from finishing the ai and current Workout page (for when the user is doing a workout), the others parts are finished, aside from minor visual improvements
23/02/2024, 18:48 - Nik: Yeah, I will focus on these functionalities when I get back from the netherlands
23/02/2024, 18:48 - Nik: But I want to do some more visual improvements today :)
23/02/2024, 18:49 - EthanT: Misha's working on the ai, not sure who said they would do the current workout
23/02/2024, 18:49 - EthanT: I'll get some animations uploaded as well
23/02/2024, 19:41 - Nik: Damn, I didn't plan to work so much on the proj today. Anyway, this is what I did in short:

1. Tested out a new global color combination ✨
- Applied the new colors EVERYWHERE

2. Formatted all code
* Formatted the entire Java codebase
* Formatted all xml files

3. Added a new dimentions xml file to reference text sizes

2. Improved the design of the 3 Forgot Password pages ✨
* Forgot Passowrd
* Forgot Password Continued
* Forgot Password Check

4. Fixed margins, text sizes, and text colors in A LOT of pages ✨
23/02/2024, 19:42 - Nik: So mostly design improvements. Hopefully you all like them. There is still a long way to go, but I believe that we are going in the right direction.
23/02/2024, 19:42 - Nik: In the next 3-4 days I am probably not going to work on the proj at all, but after the Netherlands I will focus on it again (until the poster fair).
25/02/2024, 20:24 - Misha: Hey guys I’m gonna be working on my deliverable tonight but won’t be able to join the meeting in person as I have an urgent doctors appointment that only starts at 11:15 and I won’t make it to Kennedy in time, I’ll definitely join on teams 👍
25/02/2024, 20:25 - EthanT: All good!
26/02/2024, 11:57 - Juan: I will be joining on teams as well because I'm in London
26/02/2024, 12:01 - Misha: I’ll be joining on teams in just a minute
26/02/2024, 12:01 - Misha: Trying to find the link…
26/02/2024, 12:05 - EthanT: Are you in the meeting now?
26/02/2024, 12:05 - Juan: Me and Misha are
26/02/2024, 12:06 - EthanT: Ok. Sergey hasn't turned up here
26/02/2024, 12:06 - Juan: Ok cool
26/02/2024, 12:06 - Misha: <Media omitted>
26/02/2024, 12:06 - Misha: 😢
26/02/2024, 12:07 - Juan: Oh no 😬
26/02/2024, 12:08 - Misha: It’s a time bomb 😂
26/02/2024, 12:08 - Misha: I’m like 10 min away from home so should be alright
26/02/2024, 12:08 - Juan: 😂
26/02/2024, 12:15 - Misha: Has he not turned up yet?
26/02/2024, 12:17 - EthanT: Nope
26/02/2024, 13:26 - EthanT: Just saw Sergey, I've let him know we're just doing general improvements and final fixes for the app
26/02/2024, 13:41 - Misha: Oh nice nice
27/02/2024, 23:41 - EthanT: Done quite a few commits today:

- With Misha, we decided to add a few more columns to the exercises, with sets reps and time. Reason is for when the user is doing a workout, if theres a value in the timer, we can set a timer going, whereas if its reps, we wait for user input. Not much code has changed, and the appropriate code has been changed.

- AI page is also nearly done, Misha was able to fix a token problem.

- Ive also created a "workout hub", where once a user has either  selected, generated or created a workout, they are taken to a page that gives them options about the workout, including actually starting the workout.

- Some formatting on the ItemVisualiser's has been done too, bolding the title etc.

Ill be in the library for a while, doing some error checking, making sure no crashes occur.
27/02/2024, 23:41 - EthanT: Id also suggest meeting Thursday so we can do a rundown of the poster fair
28/02/2024, 00:06 - EthanT: Also changing how the navigation bar functions, with the current colour palette, I cannot see at all whats selected lol
28/02/2024, 14:09 - Nik: When is the data and text noodle quiz btw?
28/02/2024, 16:09 - Nik: Also, do you know if we are allowed to vote for our own posters? If yes - why? It is logical that we are not. But if we are... I am voting for ours haha
28/02/2024, 16:10 - EthanT: Presumably yh
28/02/2024, 16:13 - Nik: How did the meeting go, did anyone take notes?
28/02/2024, 16:13 - Nik: Oh, I guess it didn't happen
28/02/2024, 16:20 - EthanT: Ye, me and Manuel were they but left after an hour
28/02/2024, 16:21 - Nik: Yeah, I can do that later today :)
28/02/2024, 16:24 - EthanT: I'll finish the encryption, I tired to register but I get an exception of invalid user details. May be the password, but I've had issues before when I try to register and the app crashed due to an on purpose crash
28/02/2024, 16:25 - Nik: I can take a look at that as well. I’ll let you know if I start working on it. Please let me know if you do the same, so that we do not work on the same thing at the same time (because of merge issues and stuff)
28/02/2024, 16:25 - EthanT: I'm doing it now
28/02/2024, 16:25 - Nik: Nice
28/02/2024, 16:53 - EthanT: Encryptions finished
28/02/2024, 19:10 - EthanT: Is everyone available to meet tomorrow for a rehearsal of the poster fair?
28/02/2024, 19:19 - Manuel Montero: yesss before 5pm
28/02/2024, 19:20 - EthanT: I have work at 3.45 as well
28/02/2024, 19:21 - Manuel Montero: I just had a 3 h nap from the exhaustion
28/02/2024, 19:25 - EthanT: I've fixed all the bugs I can find, only on left is settings I'd enabled whilst annamous but I'll fix that before I go out tonight
28/02/2024, 19:26 - EthanT: Others well fix during the rehearsal
28/02/2024, 19:26 - Manuel Montero: Okayyy
28/02/2024, 20:13 - Nik: Let’s do it before that then
28/02/2024, 20:13 - Nik: Honestly, I should be available as early as 12
28/02/2024, 20:13 - Nik: If you all are free, we can meet at the library at 12
28/02/2024, 20:13 - EthanT: Sounds good
28/02/2024, 20:14 - Manuel Montero: I have an online chiropractor videoconference 11-12, I can be there 12:30 or so
28/02/2024, 20:14 - Misha: 12 or 12:30 is good with me
28/02/2024, 20:16 - Nik: So 12-12:30 at the library?
28/02/2024, 20:17 - Manuel Montero: yas
28/02/2024, 20:18 - Juan: Tomorrow I will be arriving to Canterbury at 4pm but I could join online
28/02/2024, 21:56 - EthanT: I've got the encryption system working but I think someone's merge broke it, I'll check it later
28/02/2024, 22:32 - Juan: Oh when I merged I removed the decrypt method because it wasn't allowing me to compile and i forgot to add it back
28/02/2024, 22:32 - Juan: I just added it back
28/02/2024, 22:34 - EthanT: All good, I registered a new account and it encrypted ok. I think tidb is bugging since some sql I added disappeared
28/02/2024, 22:39 - Juan: Btw are you able to login to the application?
28/02/2024, 22:44 - EthanT: I created an account, test1@gmail.com. it encrypted correclty
28/02/2024, 22:46 - EthanT: I did change the var length since the encrypted message is alot longer than the original varchar size
28/02/2024, 22:48 - Juan: Oh ok so can we use the decrypted word to login?
28/02/2024, 22:48 - Juan: Or do we have to use the encrypted version?
28/02/2024, 22:50 - EthanT: It encrypts using sha3, everything is handled in thr code. When you sign in its just using a normal password
28/02/2024, 22:53 - Juan: Ok so I'm guessing I should create a new account because the password for test@gmail.com isn't encrypted
28/02/2024, 22:53 - Juan: Maybe that's why is not letting me login
28/02/2024, 22:54 - EthanT: Yh, I tried to delete the accounts but I'm out and tidb doesn't work well on my phone. Use test1@gmail.com with the same password
28/02/2024, 22:56 - Juan: I just created a new account and it allowed me in 😄
28/02/2024, 22:56 - Juan: Thanks
28/02/2024, 22:57 - EthanT: All good, just spent 5 min trying to screenshot tidb 😅
28/02/2024, 22:58 - Juan: Oh no 😂
28/02/2024, 22:58 - EthanT: It should keep the app the same as it is, and gives us another talking point for Friday about data security
28/02/2024, 22:58 - Juan: It's all good now
28/02/2024, 23:00 - Juan: Although I'm seeing that when I click on history the app keeps crashing. This is probably related with the problems that's the database is having right now
28/02/2024, 23:01 - EthanT: I added some code earlier that checks if there's values for history, if there is it shows as empty
28/02/2024, 23:01 - Juan: Very true
28/02/2024, 23:03 - EthanT: I'll check the code when I get back, bugs like these we'll try fix at the rehearsal
28/02/2024, 23:08 - Juan: 👍🏼
28/02/2024, 23:50 - Nik: Just just to clarify, since some of you said that they are going to be able to join at 12:30, let’s do it then.
28/02/2024, 23:50 - EthanT: Yep, 12.30 start is cool with me
29/02/2024, 01:34 - Nik: My android studio is lagging so much for some reason
29/02/2024, 01:35 - Misha: It’s trying to sleep 😴
29/02/2024, 01:36 - Misha: Mine was too lately
29/02/2024, 01:36 - Misha: Making the laptop lag
29/02/2024, 02:25 - Nik: I asked Asya to join us tomorrow for a few minutes if she has time
29/02/2024, 02:25 - Nik: I want to let her see the app on an actual phone, if you all are fine with that
29/02/2024, 02:26 - Nik: she hasn't started working on a logo yet, unfortunately. She told me it's hard creating a logo when we do not have a name...
29/02/2024, 02:26 - Nik: Btw I didn't do a lot tonight, but I identified some issues:
29/02/2024, 02:26 - Nik: FIX Workouts -> Search bug

In Workouts -> AI
-> Showing a page with just one button is unnecessary. Instead have the AI workout page immidiately.

When resetting a password, the new password isn't encrypted (brakes and the user cannot enter)

When resetting a password, the new password can be whatever (doesn't follow requirements, such as min 6 symbols, etc.)

Think of a name.

Design a better logo.

Change nav bar colors.

Prevent users from registering with the same email twice.
29/02/2024, 02:26 - EthanT: Thats fine,  the final logo can be part of the final version
29/02/2024, 02:26 - Nik: I will add them to GitLab, but not today
29/02/2024, 02:27 - Nik: Have a good sleep/party :) Gn
29/02/2024, 02:30 - EthanT: I haven't added the encryption code for resetting password, shouldn't take too long.

The requirements of password resetting  is probably an oversight, ill add validation code tomorrow. 

The AI page we'll discuss with misha tomorrow

Registration with same email is already prevented in the db since the email is the primary key
29/02/2024, 02:31 - EthanT: Ive just got back from venue 🤣 but dont have the energy to code rn
29/02/2024, 02:36 - Nik: Yes, it is prevented. I saw that. However, the user never gets notified that he couldn't create a second account with the same email. So if he forgot that he has an account with a particular email, he thinks that he's just created an account with some new password, but then wouldn't be able to login, since he already had an account with an old password.
29/02/2024, 02:37 - Nik: What we need to do is to stop him and tell him that an account with that email already exists
29/02/2024, 02:37 - Nik: dw
29/02/2024, 02:37 - Nik: go to bed
29/02/2024, 02:37 - Nik: I'll do the same
29/02/2024, 02:38 - EthanT: Ah thats fair, since you created the registeration page I left it to you, I struggled tbh to add the encryption code to registration. We'll discuss it tomorrrow
29/02/2024, 02:38 - EthanT: I need to eat first 🤣, then for sure
29/02/2024, 11:52 - Misha: Sorry boys gonna be a little late, if everyones there before me just start without me, I'll be on campus for a couple hours anyway
29/02/2024, 11:55 - Nik: I’ll make some brunch rn and then will head to the library. Will try to be there at around 12:30, but may be a bit late.
29/02/2024, 11:56 - EthanT: I'm heading to gulbenkian for brunch, shouldn't be too late either
29/02/2024, 12:30 - EthanT: Omw to the library
29/02/2024, 12:30 - Nik: Same
29/02/2024, 12:33 - Manuel Montero: me too im 7 min away
29/02/2024, 12:33 - Misha: I’ll be there 20 min sorry
29/02/2024, 12:34 - Nik: Nw
29/02/2024, 12:35 - EthanT: I'm waiting in the main entrance
29/02/2024, 12:41 - Manuel Montero: r u camping
29/02/2024, 12:42 - Manuel Montero: where are thou babygorl
29/02/2024, 12:42 - EthanT: 1a now

29/02/2024, 12:53 - Misha: There in 10 min
29/02/2024, 12:53 - Misha: Maybe less
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: R u guys in 1a?
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Manuel Montero: Yessir
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: Where 😂
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Manuel Montero: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: Shit I’m lost
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Manuel Montero: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: I swear I’m in 1a
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: Oh fuck I’m far down the alphabet
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: In D
29/02/2024, 13:03 - Misha: Omw
29/02/2024, 14:01 - EthanT: TODO Today

Add workout to history after clicking begin workout in the workout hub (and take you to history)
Fix password encrypt and requirement in Forget password page and change password page
Get AI Page working and tested
29/02/2024, 14:46 - Juan: I could help with the history part but my coach is delayed so I won't be able to work on it until I arrive home around 5pm
29/02/2024, 14:47 - Manuel Montero: Me and Ethan just did that part!
29/02/2024, 14:47 - Juan: Ok great 👍
29/02/2024, 14:48 - Juan: Let me know if there's anything you would like me to help with for when I get home
29/02/2024, 14:54 - Misha: I’ll be working on error checking on my page and overall just polishing it
29/02/2024, 15:28 - Misha: Created a potential issue, nothing too important nor big but should be checked out
29/02/2024, 15:29 - Manuel Montero: we created several potential issues 🤠
29/02/2024, 15:29 - EthanT: Dress code is polo shirts if that cool with everyone
29/02/2024, 15:29 - Manuel Montero: trouser policy?
29/02/2024, 15:30 - Misha: I think i got a dark blue  polo shirt
29/02/2024, 15:30 - Misha: cream trousers for me
29/02/2024, 15:31 - Manuel Montero: same!!!
29/02/2024, 15:35 - Misha: nvm my android studio was being weird and making the app crash everywhere, all good for now
29/02/2024, 16:02 - EthanT: Just fixed the create workout not adding an exercise to history. JSON function now returns an id. ill push the change and well test later
29/02/2024, 16:02 - Nik: I am trying to fix the registration issue
29/02/2024, 16:03 - Nik: And the encryption task is basically done
29/02/2024, 16:13 - EthanT: Whilst I wait for the registration to work, ill look into toolbar
29/02/2024, 16:21 - EthanT: My android studio just crashed and its not letting me reopen it on my pc...
29/02/2024, 16:21 - EthanT: You cant make this up...
29/02/2024, 16:29 - Misha: That’s weird
29/02/2024, 16:29 - Manuel Montero: 🤠🤠🤠
29/02/2024, 16:29 - Manuel Montero: I’m sorry y’all I think someone did witchcraft on me
29/02/2024, 16:30 - EthanT: Just fixed it, no idea what I done but I think it signed me out of raptor, thats why it broke
29/02/2024, 17:00 - Nik: I am still working on the registration error
29/02/2024, 17:00 - Nik: I believe I am in the right direction
29/02/2024, 17:00 - Nik: I’ve changed so much code…
29/02/2024, 17:01 - Nik: I will push in 10-15 mins, so that you all are up to date with the latest changes
29/02/2024, 17:01 - EthanT: I'm working on getting the toolbar to be thr right size, also meeting up with misha to finish the ai page
29/02/2024, 17:37 - Nik: Almost fixed the error
29/02/2024, 17:37 - Nik: I had to add some print statements, but they are all neat and good looking
29/02/2024, 17:37 - Nik: I suggest that we leave them there in case we need to do future debugging
29/02/2024, 17:44 - Nik: Ok, I have a new problem
29/02/2024, 17:44 - EthanT: I may know it
29/02/2024, 17:44 - Nik: I am not sure if it is only on my machine, but it's that
29/02/2024, 17:44 - Nik: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 17:44 - EthanT: Login is disabled across all branches
29/02/2024, 17:44 - Nik: YES
29/02/2024, 17:44 - Nik: EXACTLY
29/02/2024, 17:45 - Nik: Why
29/02/2024, 17:45 - EthanT: Db connection test fails
29/02/2024, 17:45 - EthanT: It's a database isssue
29/02/2024, 17:46 - Nik: RIGHT
29/02/2024, 17:46 - Nik: I’ve located that this is the issue
29/02/2024, 17:46 - Nik: And I am trying to figure out why the db connection fails
29/02/2024, 17:47 - Misha: Everything seems fine but for some reason it keeps failing
29/02/2024, 17:48 - Nik: It's in here somewhere
29/02/2024, 17:48 - Nik: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 17:48 - EthanT: The codes fine, it's been running all day
29/02/2024, 17:48 - EthanT: I think its an issue with the database itself
29/02/2024, 17:48 - Nik: That’s insane. Could it be TIDB issue?
29/02/2024, 17:49 - EthanT: Perhaps
29/02/2024, 17:50 - Nik: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 17:50 - Nik: st is null
29/02/2024, 17:50 - Nik: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 17:50 - Nik: but is shoudn't be
29/02/2024, 17:50 - EthanT: It would be if it can't connect to the db surely?
29/02/2024, 17:51 - Nik: conn is null as well
29/02/2024, 17:51 - Nik: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 17:51 - EthanT: The last change to dbconnection was a month ago
29/02/2024, 17:51 - Nik: so it must be here
29/02/2024, 17:51 - Nik: <Media omitted>
29/02/2024, 17:51 - Nik: I know... so strange
29/02/2024, 17:53 - Misha: it was working 30 min ago no and suddenly has stopped working
29/02/2024, 17:53 - Misha: And no changes were made on the main branch in the last 30 min
29/02/2024, 17:54 - Misha: So it can't be an error on our end
29/02/2024, 17:56 - EthanT: I'm doing a data restore from this morning
29/02/2024, 17:58 - EthanT: FIXED!
29/02/2024, 17:58 - Misha: haha
29/02/2024, 17:58 - Nik: HOW
29/02/2024, 17:58 - EthanT: Restore
29/02/2024, 17:58 - Nik: What do you mean restore
29/02/2024, 17:58 - Nik: What did you restore exactly
29/02/2024, 17:59 - EthanT: I restored a backup from 3am
29/02/2024, 17:59 - Nik: A back up of what?
29/02/2024, 17:59 - Misha: the database
29/02/2024, 17:59 - Misha: TIDB
29/02/2024, 17:59 - Nik: Are you at the library, guys?
29/02/2024, 17:59 - EthanT: Yep
29/02/2024, 17:59 - Nik: Because I am here
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Nik: Where at
29/02/2024, 18:00 - EthanT: 1a
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Nik: Let’s meet somewhere, but 1a was too laid
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Nik: *loud
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Nik: What about 2 c?
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Misha: it's quiet here now
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Misha: less people
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Nik: Ok, I am coming
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Misha: but still some noise
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Misha: if thats what you mean
29/02/2024, 18:00 - Misha: if it's too noisy we'll go somewhere else
29/02/2024, 21:37 - Juan: Guys do you know how we are being assessed tomorrow?
29/02/2024, 21:41 - Manuel Montero: it’s not marked
29/02/2024, 21:41 - Manuel Montero: as far as I know
29/02/2024, 21:49 - Juan: Oh I thought it was, thanks Manu
29/02/2024, 23:13 - EthanT: Im doing some testing on the code, doing a download at midnight, then a final one before the fair
29/02/2024, 23:50 - Nik: 💪
01/03/2024, 01:14 - Misha: im gonna test if the workout generated is different if the use selects different options
01/03/2024, 01:14 - Misha: might cost a few tokens haha
01/03/2024, 01:15 - EthanT: I checked the token usage, 8000 but it seems to barely used 1 pence
01/03/2024, 01:15 - Misha: good good
01/03/2024, 01:15 - Misha: is it giving ocassional errors when generating btw?
01/03/2024, 01:16 - EthanT: I ran into it, ironically the first time I tried but couldn't get it again
01/03/2024, 01:16 - EthanT: I have a potential fix I'll add tomorrow
01/03/2024, 01:16 - EthanT: Most of my changes from 20 min ago was design improvement and fixing a major history bug
01/03/2024, 01:19 - Misha: hmm
01/03/2024, 01:19 - Misha: i just hope it doesnt come up when we're showing
01/03/2024, 01:19 - Misha: im not sure what the error is
01/03/2024, 01:19 - EthanT: My fix is to check if the incorrect syntax exist and simply remove the first and last character
01/03/2024, 01:20 - Misha: 👍
01/03/2024, 01:20 - Misha: Ok so then I won’t test the ai
01/03/2024, 01:20 - Misha: I’ll just do some design improvements
01/03/2024, 01:21 - EthanT: I did a signicant amount of changes and added to main so make sure you pull them to your branch
01/03/2024, 02:04 - Misha: @447514583905
01/03/2024, 02:04 - Misha: <Media omitted>
01/03/2024, 02:04 - Misha: did u change something maybe?
01/03/2024, 02:06 - EthanT: If the ai crashes, that happens
01/03/2024, 02:06 - Misha: oh..
01/03/2024, 02:06 - Misha: it keeps happening
01/03/2024, 02:06 - Misha: after I open the app
01/03/2024, 02:07 - EthanT: Strange. I'll check tomorrow when I wake up, only commit I done was if the dB is offline, to set createLinear layout as gone like the ai option is
01/03/2024, 02:08 - Misha: good stuff
01/03/2024, 09:13 - Nik: Dw
01/03/2024, 09:37 - Nik: Just a reminder: today at 12 at the library
01/03/2024, 10:57 - EthanT: Grabbing brunch rn, I'll see you at the library
01/03/2024, 11:03 - Nik: I am getting dressed in a few minutes and am heading to the library as well.
01/03/2024, 11:39 - Manuel Montero: it’s raining guys
01/03/2024, 11:39 - EthanT: It is
01/03/2024, 11:39 - EthanT: And I have no coat
01/03/2024, 11:39 - Nik: Hahah
01/03/2024, 11:39 - Nik: You said you are grabbing it yesterday
01/03/2024, 11:39 - EthanT: I was when I went swimming but we were in the library for too long
01/03/2024, 11:41 - Misha: It’s wetter than a swimming pool where I am
01/03/2024, 11:42 - Nik: Indeed
01/03/2024, 11:42 - Manuel Montero: im with Asya omg
01/03/2024, 11:42 - Nik: Yeah, she must be in the library rn
01/03/2024, 11:43 - Nik: I am heading there in a minute
01/03/2024, 11:43 - Manuel Montero: she’s next to me hehehe
01/03/2024, 11:43 - Manuel Montero: what a coincidence
01/03/2024, 11:54 - Misha: We’re meeting in 1a?
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Manuel Montero: me and Nik are in the cafr
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Manuel Montero: cafe*
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Manuel Montero: but we are meeting somewhere else
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Manuel Montero: just waiting
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Nik: No, let’s do 1c or 2c
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Misha: Me
And Ethan are in 1a
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Nik: 1a was too loud
01/03/2024, 12:03 - Nik: Let’s all go to 1c
01/03/2024, 12:06 - Misha: We csn come but there’s like 3 groups here and they’re far
01/03/2024, 12:06 - Misha: If anything we move
01/03/2024, 12:07 - Juan: Guys I should be arriving in about 15 mins
01/03/2024, 12:12 - EthanT: GENERAL DISCUSSION POINTS:

- Standard health app - familar to users
- Enhanced by ai - alows for more tailored workouts to the user
	- Helpful for those new to workouts.

- Data privacy is the first priroity
	- Password encryption
	- User has full control over their data.
	- Anonmonus mode
		- Nothing about the user is saved but is still able to browse workouts.

DEMO (Most demos will be guided by others to allow for more freedom but some specific exist):
	- Search workout (show filter usage)
	- Create (show creation and location in Search).
	- AI (different prompts) -------- CHECK FOR BUG!

IMPROVEMENTS:
 - General design improvements and consistency.
 - AI improvemnets (more repsoncesive, better otpions, quick AI on home).
 - Performance improvements (search with many workouts could be an issue)
 - Homepage (Quick AI, recent workouts, step counter etc)
 - Accessability.

TO DO NOW!
- Filter bug - spinners dont remember data
- Check for AI bug - implement potnential fix!
01/03/2024, 12:22 - Juan: Where are you guys at?
01/03/2024, 12:22 - EthanT: 1a
01/03/2024, 12:22 - Misha: <Media omitted>
01/03/2024, 12:22 - Nik: Below silent area
01/03/2024, 12:22 - Juan: Ok
01/03/2024, 19:33 - EthanT: Great work today everyone, poster fair seemed to go really well and people seemed very interested in what the final version could look like. The final steps I can think of are:

Bug fixing - noticed some whilst registering

Ai - improve consistently

Database- add time column to allow for history to filter by time

Design - overall improvements, colours etc

Functionality - homepage, quick ai, workout process (showing the user how to do a workout)
01/03/2024, 19:33 - EthanT: I'll try to start work on a few of these eventually, most likely quick ai, but I have another project due next Friday to do
01/03/2024, 21:02 - Nik: True
01/03/2024, 21:02 - Nik: I have the same project, haha
01/03/2024, 21:02 - Nik: I'll try to do some small cosmetic changes tonight
01/03/2024, 21:02 - Nik: But then thats it for a few days, haha
01/03/2024, 22:02 - Nik: Done for today and probably for the week :)
01/03/2024, 22:02 - Nik: Just did design improvements
03/03/2024, 23:39 - EthanT: Ive done some minor functional changes, notable fixing the weight / height issues. Its now set as text in DB (to allow for units), as well as the input now being decimal. Also fixed the height units not appearing, and added the show password functionality wherever needed
04/03/2024, 01:58 - Nik: Great
04/03/2024, 01:59 - Nik: I also did design normalization and globalization
04/03/2024, 01:59 - Nik: Now we can easily change the appearance of the entire app
04/03/2024, 11:07 - EthanT: Are we still meeting at 12?
04/03/2024, 11:08 - Nik: Yeah, let’s meet
04/03/2024, 11:08 - Nik: However, it can be a shorter meeting if you want
04/03/2024, 11:08 - Nik: Because a lot of us are not going to work on the project this week
04/03/2024, 11:08 - EthanT: I'm grabbing food so I may be a few minutes late
04/03/2024, 11:09 - Nik: It’s in 50 mins, dw
04/03/2024, 11:09 - EthanT: I still need to shower as well 😅
04/03/2024, 11:22 - Manuel Montero: I have a parcel coming between 11-12 apparently so I might be a bit late 😔
04/03/2024, 11:23 - EthanT: I've got to head to Next after, parcels arrived
04/03/2024, 11:23 - Manuel Montero: Ohhhh nice! did you get ur coat?
04/03/2024, 11:23 - EthanT: Got the coat yesterday, but I ordered a new shirt and trousers for tuesday
04/03/2024, 11:23 - Misha: I can’t join today unfortunately but if anything important is said let me know
04/03/2024, 11:52 - EthanT: I should be there in 20
04/03/2024, 11:58 - Nik: @447452833836 ?
04/03/2024, 11:59 - Juan: I'm on my way
04/03/2024, 11:59 - Juan: Should be there in 5 mins
04/03/2024, 12:05 - Manuel Montero: I’m still waiting for my parcel so maybe I’ll join on Teams bc I don’t want to deal with Park Wood reception
04/03/2024, 12:05 - Manuel Montero: 😩
04/03/2024, 12:06 - EthanT: I'm finishing, so i should be there in 5
04/03/2024, 12:11 - EthanT: Omw
04/03/2024, 12:18 - Manuel Montero: my teams is not connecting 😭
06/03/2024, 17:46 - EthanT: Just done some major changes to session data and the settings page, will do some testing for it later
06/03/2024, 21:43 - Manuel Montero: I think I have to update my Android Studio, I can’t run the app bc of the Gradle and I can’t run the gradle version in Hedgehog
07/03/2024, 16:41 - EthanT: Id suggest people pull that latest version of main if they tried to run the app in the past few days, had an issue with login thats now fixed
07/03/2024, 16:41 - EthanT: Also added some transitions for settings page
08/03/2024, 17:26 - Nik: I am going to pull rn to see what's going on
08/03/2024, 17:46 - EthanT: Ill continue with some work later
08/03/2024, 17:48 - Nik: niceee
08/03/2024, 18:07 - Nik: I also just pushed some big commit in which I do a lot of file renaming.
08/03/2024, 18:07 - Nik: So please pull the latest changes from main, before writing new code.
08/03/2024, 18:07 - EthanT: Will do!
08/03/2024, 18:10 - Misha: <Media omitted>
08/03/2024, 18:11 - EthanT: Im pulling from main now
08/03/2024, 22:34 - Nik: I did make changes, yes
08/03/2024, 22:34 - Nik: I thought I hadn't pushed anything that breaks stuff though
08/03/2024, 22:34 - Nik: I am currently trying to make the workout options page using fragments
08/03/2024, 22:34 - Nik: It should be fine in 5 mins
08/03/2024, 22:34 - Nik: just let me check
08/03/2024, 22:36 - EthanT: I haven't had time to do any changes, I'll try running main after I've eaten.
I'm working this weekend on changing the navigation bar to action / tool bar and finishing transitions on settings
08/03/2024, 22:39 - Nik: I am pushing rn
08/03/2024, 22:42 - Nik: Just pushed my last commit. Main looks fine. No error on my machine, everything is running smooth. The only issue is that animations are scuffed now. I've commented the code for the animations out and wrote TODO comments above
08/03/2024, 22:42 - Nik: If there is anything, ping me and I'll try to fix it tomorrow
08/03/2024, 22:42 - Nik: Goon night, lads
08/03/2024, 22:43 - EthanT: I'll pull in 20, and add my changes!
08/03/2024, 22:44 - EthanT: I can get the animations fixed, they'll be added thr same as the settings view that's slightly different implemention
09/03/2024, 02:15 - Nik: Hey all, I just revamped all buttons and then globalized their style in the styles xml (res -> values -> styles.xml). Hope you like it
09/03/2024, 02:16 - Nik: I am pulling your changes rn
09/03/2024, 02:16 - EthanT: Finished settings transitions and start tool bar here as well, will upload tomorrow since I need to do some testing
09/03/2024, 02:18 - Nik: The animations are great btw, the only issue now is that in the workouts options when I go from AI to Manual the animations slides in the wrong direction
09/03/2024, 02:18 - Nik: But I might be able to fix it, will try rn
09/03/2024, 02:19 - EthanT: You can probably add a toggle to flip the inputs, depending on how you set it up. I need to sleep first 😅😴
09/03/2024, 02:26 - Nik: Fixed it :)
09/03/2024, 02:26 - Nik: Go to bed, bro
09/03/2024, 02:26 - Nik: Gn
09/03/2024, 13:10 - EthanT: Ive gotten settings page to work with transitions but currently cant find an easy way to get a global navigation bar. Ill keep researching a little more, but if not ill start work on getting fragments working
09/03/2024, 14:38 - Nik: Yeah, I think fragments is the way
09/03/2024, 14:38 - Nik: I moved the workout options page into fragments yesterday
09/03/2024, 14:38 - EthanT: Perfect, been working on that for a while, will get that done today 👍
09/03/2024, 14:39 - Nik: This means that the workout page will be a fragment itself and will contain fragments inside it. Hmm, I wonder if that’s possible
09/03/2024, 14:39 - Nik: Hopefully it is
09/03/2024, 14:40 - Nik: If not, we’ll think of something
09/03/2024, 14:40 - Nik: I am working on a night theme rn
09/03/2024, 14:40 - EthanT: Seems you can with nested fragments
09/03/2024, 14:40 - Nik: Great
09/03/2024, 14:41 - Nik: Are you working on it now. If yes, tell me what you are editing, because I am hoping in rn and I don’t want to create merge issues
09/03/2024, 14:41 - Nik: :)
09/03/2024, 14:42 - EthanT: I'm working on home, workout option and history. Once we know the fragments work, we can start integrating the rest of the pages
09/03/2024, 14:44 - Juan: Oh I'm working on home and history as well
09/03/2024, 14:45 - EthanT: That's fine, it doenst need much changes, we can deal with the changes if need be. I havnet reached history either, starting with home -> workout option -> history
09/03/2024, 14:46 - Juan: What are you planning on changing on home and history?
09/03/2024, 14:46 - Juan: So that we don't do the same thing
09/03/2024, 14:47 - EthanT: Changing the type to a fragment so we can have a global activity that has the navigation bar. Makes the performance of the app much smoother and keeps the navigation bar in place.
09/03/2024, 14:52 - Juan: Ok nice. I'm gonna be adding some boxes to display information in the home page such as the amount of workouts completed and a place to display some statistics
09/03/2024, 15:00 - Juan: For the history I've noticed something weird. The SQL call that is being sent to the database from the getUserWorkutsLimited() returns a different output than when you run that same call SQL code in tidb
09/03/2024, 15:01 - EthanT: Have you got screenshots?
09/03/2024, 15:01 - Juan: In tidb it gives the correct amount of workouts(the last 4) but when I make that call through the method it gives all the workouts
09/03/2024, 15:01 - Juan: No but I could take some
09/03/2024, 15:01 - EthanT: And your certain its the exact same query, with the "LIMIT" in the same place?
09/03/2024, 15:02 - Juan: Yes
09/03/2024, 15:02 - Juan: I'm gonna take some screenshots
09/03/2024, 15:27 - Juan: <Media omitted>
09/03/2024, 15:27 - Juan: <Media omitted>
09/03/2024, 15:27 - Juan: <Media omitted>
09/03/2024, 15:29 - Juan: <Media omitted>
09/03/2024, 15:29 - Juan: <Media omitted>
09/03/2024, 15:30 - Juan: What's being returned from the method. Just one workout.
09/03/2024, 15:30 - Juan: What's being returned in tidb
09/03/2024, 16:10 - Nik: Guys, I am done for today. I made changes to the drawables, because there was no structure there. I then changed the themes a bit, to set the app for a dark mode and then started working on one. Currently the colors all scuffed and all, because I couldn't finish it today, but hopefully by the end of the weekend we'll have a dark mode as well :)
09/03/2024, 16:20 - EthanT: I'm finishing making some flat packed furniture, I'll check after 👍
09/03/2024, 19:21 - Nik: I couldn't help myself but do some more work on the dark mode. It is almost done now.
09/03/2024, 19:22 - Nik: . I also noticed a slight issue with the animation of the settings fragments between the third and the first fragment. The animation is in the wrong direction. That's it.
09/03/2024, 19:22 - EthanT: I haven't pushed my latest commit, ill fix it in that
09/03/2024, 19:23 - Nik: After I get the dark mode working, I want to focus on some functionality, so that we can prepare the project for submition. I was thinking of maybe doing the Enhance AI button. We can discuss on monday.
09/03/2024, 19:24 - Nik: We may also add some pictures of exercises to show in the workouts.
09/03/2024, 19:24 - Nik: If needed, we can remove the "Add to calendar" functionality for now.
09/03/2024, 20:12 - EthanT: I was going to add that or enhance ai next week :)
10/03/2024, 00:17 - EthanT: About to push the last commit, workoutOption and home are now fragments and work with the navigation bar. Transitions will be added tomorrow. Ive left history for now since Juan said he was working on that file but its not hard to remodel the code
10/03/2024, 00:25 - EthanT: So on the latest branch in main, History will be disabled until I convert it tomorrow
10/03/2024, 00:25 - EthanT: Also home takes a lot longer to load for some reason
10/03/2024, 01:23 - EthanT: I have got History converted (not continued tho), but I have an issue with the linking of some of the drawbale files so im commenting them out for now
10/03/2024, 01:26 - EthanT: You deleted this message
10/03/2024, 01:49 - EthanT: Fixed
10/03/2024, 11:37 - Nik: This is great! I'll pull now to check it out
10/03/2024, 12:46 - Nik: It is really nice and all, but I found this bug
10/03/2024, 12:46 - Nik: Unable to instantiate activity -> Pages.Fragments.MainOptions.Home (MAJOR BUG)
10/03/2024, 12:46 - Nik: I'll try to figure out how to fix it
10/03/2024, 12:47 - EthanT: Strange, I ran main last night and it seemed to work. Check where its referred in the code, sometimes typing thr variable again fixes it
10/03/2024, 12:48 - Nik: I’ll search for it now. It doesn’t happen when you log in, but it happens when you go into the search workout page and then you go back to home.
10/03/2024, 12:48 - Nik: It also happens when you access anonymous mode
10/03/2024, 12:48 - Nik: The same error
10/03/2024, 12:48 - EthanT: Annomnous I haven't tested yet
10/03/2024, 12:49 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
10/03/2024, 12:50 - Nik: I know
10/03/2024, 12:50 - Nik: But now go to search
10/03/2024, 12:50 - Nik: And to the filters
10/03/2024, 12:50 - Nik: Apply a filter
10/03/2024, 12:50 - Nik: And then go back
10/03/2024, 12:50 - EthanT: Only the 3 main pages are converted
10/03/2024, 12:50 - EthanT: None of the others are yet
10/03/2024, 12:50 - Nik: I know
10/03/2024, 12:51 - Nik: Maybe this error was there even before that
10/03/2024, 12:51 - Nik: Anyway, I’ll work on it now
10/03/2024, 12:51 - EthanT: Search isn't converted, so it tries to launch activity home, but activity home doesn't exist
10/03/2024, 12:51 - Nik: Ohhhhh
10/03/2024, 12:51 - Nik: That’s why
10/03/2024, 12:51 - EthanT: Yee
10/03/2024, 12:52 - Nik: I’ll try changing it to see
10/03/2024, 12:52 - EthanT: I'll pull the main to mine after and convert the rest of activities to fragments
10/03/2024, 12:56 - Nik: Bro, I was so confused to what that container file was
10/03/2024, 12:57 - Nik: Because it was just in the main folder
10/03/2024, 12:57 - EthanT: Ye I didn't get time to move it
10/03/2024, 12:57 - Nik: Now I understand that this is the home page container and stuff
10/03/2024, 12:57 - Nik: And it should be created first
10/03/2024, 12:57 - EthanT: Yep, I'll name change later
10/03/2024, 12:57 - Nik: I am doing that now, it is ok
10/03/2024, 12:58 - Nik: I’ll call it HomeContainer or sth
10/03/2024, 12:58 - EthanT: ActivtyContainer
It contains everything not just the home
10/03/2024, 13:03 - Nik: btw
10/03/2024, 13:03 - Nik: what is that:
10/03/2024, 13:03 - Nik: <Media omitted>
10/03/2024, 13:03 - Nik: it give error
10/03/2024, 13:03 - Nik: was it like that yesterday?
10/03/2024, 13:03 - EthanT: Added yesterday, delete up to databinding and retype jt
10/03/2024, 13:04 - Nik: what? Instead of that: import com.firstapp.group10app.databinding.ActivityContainerBinding;
10/03/2024, 13:04 - Nik: I should have what
10/03/2024, 13:05 - Nik: ?
import com.firstapp.group10app.ActivityContainerBinding;
10/03/2024, 13:05 - EthanT: Same thing but retype it. Sometimes android studio doesn't get the import initially. I have it sometimes with drawable resources
10/03/2024, 13:07 - Nik: Strange... didn't fix it for me
10/03/2024, 13:07 - Nik: I'll check stackoverflow
10/03/2024, 13:07 - EthanT: Give me 5 and ill check
10/03/2024, 13:10 - Nik: ok
10/03/2024, 13:10 - Nik: stackoverflow talks about changing gradle and then adjusting some settings
10/03/2024, 13:10 - Nik: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57117338/how-to-use-view-binding-in-android
10/03/2024, 13:10 - Nik: But I'll wait for you
10/03/2024, 13:10 - EthanT: It should work though, is your gradle synced?
10/03/2024, 13:11 - Nik: I am syncing now
10/03/2024, 13:12 - Nik: <Media omitted>
10/03/2024, 13:14 - Nik: Yes, it was that
10/03/2024, 13:14 - Nik: I sinced it
10/03/2024, 13:14 - EthanT: 👍
10/03/2024, 13:14 - Nik: And there is no error now
10/03/2024, 13:14 - Nik: <Media omitted>
10/03/2024, 13:14 - Nik: I am yet to run though
10/03/2024, 13:47 - Nik: I fixed the bug. Will also globalize the nav menu behaviour.
10/03/2024, 13:48 - Nik: It was not a bug, honestly, just it was not finished
10/03/2024, 13:48 - Nik: *it was just not finished
10/03/2024, 13:49 - EthanT: Yh, I uploaded the basic model with home, option and history implemented. im doing the rest now
10/03/2024, 13:49 - EthanT: Is it not done already since its handled in ActivityContainer
10/03/2024, 13:49 - Nik: I did it
10/03/2024, 13:49 - Nik: I mean I fixed this particular thing. I haven
10/03/2024, 13:49 - Nik: *I haven't transferred any pagaes to be fragments yet though
10/03/2024, 13:50 - EthanT: Yee that's what im doing now, transfaerring the pages I didn't convert last night
10/03/2024, 13:50 - Nik: I'll push to main now. Please pull, because merge errors might emerge otherwise.
10/03/2024, 13:50 - EthanT: Ye I know
10/03/2024, 13:53 - Nik: Just merged with main
10/03/2024, 13:53 - Nik: You can pull.
10/03/2024, 13:53 - Nik: If you have anyting to push, maybe do it, so that I pull as well.
10/03/2024, 13:54 - Nik: I introduced a new bug, but I'll fix it now, it is minor.
10/03/2024, 13:54 - EthanT: I don't have anything to merge, but I noticed when navigating, you changed it so it creates a new intent of the container class. That I think will cuase nav bar to flash again
10/03/2024, 13:55 - EthanT: Ill check now
10/03/2024, 13:56 - Nik: That’s true
10/03/2024, 13:56 - Nik: I’ll fix that as well
10/03/2024, 14:04 - EthanT: lmk when you commit the change since I cant do anything without the change
10/03/2024, 14:16 - Nik: Which change exactly
10/03/2024, 14:16 - Nik: I just merged some commits with main
10/03/2024, 14:17 - EthanT: Reverseing the commit where you added the intent lines
10/03/2024, 14:17 - EthanT: I can do it tho, just pulled to my branch
10/03/2024, 14:17 - Nik: Noooo
10/03/2024, 14:18 - Nik: don't do it
10/03/2024, 14:18 - Nik: I globalized everything and it is totally different now
10/03/2024, 14:18 - Nik: don't reverse, I'll fix in a second
10/03/2024, 14:18 - EthanT: sure
10/03/2024, 14:21 - Nik: almost changed it
10/03/2024, 14:21 - Nik: just a few more mins
10/03/2024, 14:25 - Nik: I've fixed it, It is just this one error I get, that I am trying to fix. That's why I am so slow
10/03/2024, 14:30 - Nik: Ok, I am having problems with this error. I'll push to main with the error, so that you can have a look at it and maybe suggest some better solution
10/03/2024, 14:30 - EthanT: Sounds good. Whats the reason for handling nav bar in another file tho?
10/03/2024, 14:32 - Nik: Because the exact same 30 lines of code were duplicated 6-7 different times
10/03/2024, 14:32 - Nik: It also should make any changes to the nav bar behaviour easier
10/03/2024, 14:32 - Nik: because you just cahnge in one place
10/03/2024, 14:32 - Nik: Just pushed to main. The file with the error is NavBarBehaviour.
10/03/2024, 14:33 - EthanT: Most likely in files I haven't converted to fragments, or forgot to remove. Since everything will exist in a fragment, we can just have the code in ActivityContainer
10/03/2024, 14:34 - Nik: Not everything though. Settings will be different
10/03/2024, 14:35 - EthanT: wdym
10/03/2024, 14:35 - Nik: I am stupid. It wouldn’t.
10/03/2024, 14:36 - Nik: In that case let's just keep the new intents for now and just change the pages to be fragments
10/03/2024, 14:36 - Nik: would that work?
10/03/2024, 14:36 - Nik: I haven't globalized the ActivityContainer nav bar behaviour, so it shouldn't be an issue
10/03/2024, 14:36 - Nik: I am pushing last commit that removes the experiment I did, trying to fix the new intent issue
10/03/2024, 14:37 - EthanT: That should be ok, since other options just just change the fragment, e.g. bringing settigns up will change the fragment to settings
10/03/2024, 14:38 - Nik: Ok, I just pushed to main, you can pull.
10/03/2024, 14:38 - Nik: Since I am working as well, tell me which pages you are doing and which I should take
10/03/2024, 14:38 - Nik: so that we split the work,
10/03/2024, 14:42 - EthanT: 👍
10/03/2024, 14:45 - Nik: Bro, I have a new suggestion. I just noticed something
10/03/2024, 14:46 - Nik: See what Nike did
10/03/2024, 14:46 - Nik: <Media omitted>
10/03/2024, 14:47 - Nik: Here I am accessing their equivalent of our Search Workout page. In their one they just remove the nav bar and put a back arrow at the top left corner.
10/03/2024, 14:48 - Nik: I suggest that we do the same, having no nav bar at the bottom of the Search, Create and AI workout pages
10/03/2024, 14:48 - EthanT: Maybe
10/03/2024, 14:49 - Nik: This will make our life easier and the app better looking, since the pages will be slightly bigger.
10/03/2024, 14:49 - Nik: Nike probably did it for a reason, why not copy them
10/03/2024, 14:49 - Nik: If you see my point and agree with me, I am happy to do it rn.
10/03/2024, 14:50 - EthanT: Best way to do it would probably be creating a new Activity with a fragment holder, and a global arrow at the top.
10/03/2024, 14:50 - EthanT: I don't mind
10/03/2024, 15:15 - Nik: Done. Pull to check it out whenever you can.
10/03/2024, 15:16 - EthanT: Ive also changed settings so it works
10/03/2024, 15:16 - Nik: Nice :)
10/03/2024, 15:16 - EthanT: Im heading out for a few hours but ill get the rest of the fragments converted when im back, as well as transitions on the main pages
10/03/2024, 15:19 - Nik: Please push to main, so that I have the latest version
10/03/2024, 15:19 - Nik: to work on
10/03/2024, 15:19 - Nik: or nvm, I'll just pull from your branch
10/03/2024, 15:19 - EthanT: puhsing now
10/03/2024, 15:21 - EthanT: pushed
10/03/2024, 15:22 - Nik: ty
10/03/2024, 16:46 - Nik: Just letting you know, I got the following bug when attempting to create a workout:                                                                                                     java.lang.RuntimeException: org.json.JSONException: Unterminated object at character 311 of {"WorkoutName": "Nikola's Back Workout","WorkoutDuration": "30","TargetMuscleGroup": "Any","Equipment": "Chains","Difficulty": "Medium","Exercises": [{"ExerciseName": "Deadlifts","Description": "Lift the bar from the ground to hip level, keeping your back straight","TargetMuscleGroup": "Back","Equipment": "["Barbell"]","Difficulty": "Medium","Sets": "null","Reps": "null","Time": "null"},{"ExerciseName": "Pull-ups","Description": "Hang from a bar and pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar","TargetMuscleGroup": "Back","Equipment": "["Pull-up bar"]","Difficulty": "Medium","Sets": "null","Reps": "null","Time": "null"}]} <This message was edited>
10/03/2024, 16:46 - Nik: This message was deleted
10/03/2024, 16:47 - EthanT: Ai or manual
10/03/2024, 16:48 - Misha: Might be another square bracket error
10/03/2024, 16:48 - EthanT: True
10/03/2024, 16:48 - Nik: manual
10/03/2024, 16:48 - Nik: I think so
10/03/2024, 16:49 - EthanT: Try creating the workout again, same data
10/03/2024, 16:49 - EthanT: Just noticed the brackets, it's 100% that
10/03/2024, 16:52 - Misha: This message was deleted
10/03/2024, 16:52 - Misha: lol don’t know why I sent a pic of my kitchen in here
10/03/2024, 16:52 - Misha: Oops
10/03/2024, 16:52 - EthanT: Ngl, was pretty confused 😅
10/03/2024, 16:57 - Nik: Will try. I am not on my laptop rn though. Probably in 15 min will be there
10/03/2024, 16:59 - EthanT: I am pretty sure it's the exercises that are causing issues
10/03/2024, 17:10 - Nik: I tried some other and it created it no problems
10/03/2024, 17:12 - EthanT: I'll remove those exercises later
10/03/2024, 18:47 - Nik: I work on animations
10/03/2024, 18:47 - EthanT: I've got some under way for the main pages
10/03/2024, 18:54 - Nik: I already animated them
10/03/2024, 18:54 - Nik: Don’t tell me that you have them on your main and you haven’t pushed 🥲🥲🥲
10/03/2024, 18:56 - EthanT: Not yet
10/03/2024, 18:58 - Nik: Bro… please push to main, we do the same thing 😫
10/03/2024, 18:58 - EthanT: I said I didnt
10/03/2024, 18:58 - Nik: That’s good then
10/03/2024, 18:59 - Nik: I am sorry, it is just that I am extremely frustrated
10/03/2024, 19:00 - Nik: I got these bugs that I spend a lot of time fixing. In the end it turned out there was an easy fix.
10/03/2024, 21:04 - Nik: Done for the day. App is even more globalized, animations look better, some bugs were fixed, dark mode is basically finished, nav bar is removed from some pages, and the buttons are changed a bit.
10/03/2024, 21:05 - Nik: However, we've got a lot of work to do and the deadline is approaching. If we do not mobilize now, we may have to submit a partially finished app. <This message was edited>
10/03/2024, 21:06 - Nik: Or get rid of some of the functionalities (which is sad, because we had great ideas earlier this year)
10/03/2024, 21:07 - EthanT: Funnily enough, I was looking at the original idea I posted back in July. Apps definitely different to the original idea, but improved in many ways
10/03/2024, 22:03 - Misha: Hey guys tomorrow I have an important match from 12-2 and unfortunately it was not able to be moved to any other day or time, I will start my work on the things I have to do next week 👍
10/03/2024, 22:04 - Nik: Should we ask Sergey to move the meeting
10/03/2024, 22:05 - EthanT: Potentially
10/03/2024, 22:05 - Misha: Hopefully not too short notice
10/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: Because it is one of our last meetings and I am sure that he’ll have important stuff to say
10/03/2024, 22:05 - Misha: Agreed
10/03/2024, 22:05 - Misha: I'll email him
10/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: Thank you
10/03/2024, 22:06 - Misha: "Sergey Ovchinnik" <S.Ovchinnik@kent.ac.uk>
10/03/2024, 22:06 - Misha: This one?
10/03/2024, 22:06 - Nik: He has another one as well, I would email both if I were you.
10/03/2024, 22:06 - Nik: But yeah, he uses that one, as far as I know.
10/03/2024, 22:41 - Nik: Issue board on git is updated btw
11/03/2024, 10:48 - Nik: Did Sergey say something @447985120259 ? <This message was edited>
11/03/2024, 11:37 - Juan: Guys are we meeting at 12 then?
11/03/2024, 11:44 - EthanT: I'm not going to be back on campus by then
11/03/2024, 11:57 - Manuel Montero: So Sergey said he is free from 3pm until 5pm for meetings today
11/03/2024, 11:59 - Nik: Then we are meeting at 15
11/03/2024, 11:59 - Nik: So that Misha can join us
11/03/2024, 11:59 - EthanT: I should be back by then
11/03/2024, 11:59 - Manuel Montero: Awesomeeeee
11/03/2024, 12:00 - Manuel Montero: I have work at 5 so as long as we are done by 4:30 should be fine
11/03/2024, 12:01 - Misha: He’s free from 3-5
11/03/2024, 12:25 - Misha: Oh if it’s 3 I’ll join online
11/03/2024, 12:26 - Misha: I’ll reply to him
11/03/2024, 14:53 - EthanT: Grabbing a coffee, there soon
11/03/2024, 14:54 - Nik: Leaving the library rn
11/03/2024, 14:55 - Misha: Let me know when you guys are there with him I’ll call
11/03/2024, 14:57 - EthanT: May be a few minutes late
11/03/2024, 15:00 - Manuel Montero: im going im 3 min away
11/03/2024, 15:01 - EthanT: About to leave gulbenkian
11/03/2024, 15:03 - Nik: I just got here

11/03/2024, 16:37 - Juan: <Media omitted>
11/03/2024, 16:37 - Juan: <Media omitted>
11/03/2024, 20:27 - Nik: Btw dark mode is even better now. I fixed the issues we found today.
11/03/2024, 20:27 - Nik: Settings is also disabled in anonymous mode.
11/03/2024, 20:28 - Nik: And button corner radius inconsistencies are addressed.
11/03/2024, 20:29 - Nik: Also @447452833836, do you know what was causing the animation problem today? It was caused by Ethan being on a newer version of android. <This message was edited>
11/03/2024, 20:30 - Nik: Which is kinda strange
11/03/2024, 20:35 - Juan: Wow that its really strange
11/03/2024, 20:35 - Juan: But you mean android studio? Or the phone itself?
11/03/2024, 20:36 - EthanT: The phone itself
11/03/2024, 20:39 - Juan: That's so strange
12/03/2024, 00:36 - Nik: Yeah, emulated devices are having the same issue if they are on the newer version
12/03/2024, 11:44 - EthanT: Merging a commit with fragment manager globsl
12/03/2024, 11:50 - Nik: Niceee :)
12/03/2024, 17:01 - Nik: I synced the local db with tide (they had different columns)
12/03/2024, 17:03 - Nik: Also debugged it, set it up to create in a separate Thread on launch, and then made it log its contents after
12/03/2024, 17:03 - EthanT: Ive finishing off work on enhance
12/03/2024, 17:03 - Nik: Ohhh, does it work?
12/03/2024, 17:04 - Nik: Mine is not done yet, I have to connect it to the exercise and workout elements, which would be another few hours of debugging probably.
12/03/2024, 17:04 - Nik: But then it should be done. Hopefully by the end of the week.
12/03/2024, 17:17 - EthanT: I haven't tested the prompt yet and im working on remodelling the ItemVisualiser files
12/03/2024, 18:45 - EthanT: Pushing a mostly working version of enhance, everything works but the AI response, it says it has no API key oddly, but the code is identical to WorkoutAI, so I created an issue and have assigned @447985120259 and I to it, since he did a fair amount of it
12/03/2024, 18:45 - EthanT: Also need to add code to insert the new workout, that wont take long
12/03/2024, 19:51 - Nik: I see. Strange the thing with the api key, because generate workouts works.
12/03/2024, 19:51 - EthanT: My thoughts exactly
12/03/2024, 19:52 - Nik: @447753129330, what were you doing again this week, I forgot?
12/03/2024, 19:54 - EthanT: I belive its the enhance ai as well. There's still a lot to do with the design that you can do
12/03/2024, 21:55 - Manuel Montero: I am helping Ethan right? With the enhance AI thing?
12/03/2024, 23:19 - EthanT: Indeed
13/03/2024, 10:10 - Nik: He’s almost done though
13/03/2024, 10:13 - Nik: I don’t know what else to give you though. Ideas?
13/03/2024, 10:13 - EthanT: There's still a lot to do on it, there's no design currently on it at all, and needs to be added
13/03/2024, 10:14 - EthanT: We also need some data for thr database as well
13/03/2024, 10:14 - Nik: Wasn’t I doing that?
13/03/2024, 10:14 - Nik: Now that’s something that noone has taken yet I think <This message was edited>
13/03/2024, 10:15 - EthanT: Nor for the enhance workout page. I presumed me and Manuel would do the whole thing, functional and design
13/03/2024, 10:15 - Nik: Then these two sound perfect, since functionality is almost done @447753129330
13/03/2024, 10:38 - Nik: I just saw your commit, Juan. Good job 👍. I made slight changes to the button in the first page. Also globalized the margins and added a back button to the history contained within page. Apart from that, I think the history page was great and it seems to be done. <This message was edited>
14/03/2024, 00:53 - Nik: Guys, I am kinda pround of myself right now. I found out how to set up a default uncaught exctention behaviour and just did it. It is supposed to catch any exception through the code that remains uncaught and then to return the user to the main activity, telling him that an error occurred and he's been logged out. I tested it out and it seems to work. If it really works (I haven't tested it enough), then maybe android isn't going to tell us anymore that our app is bad because it crashes often  :) <This message was edited>
14/03/2024, 00:58 - EthanT: Ill try get some more work done over the weekend, add more functionality to some of the buttons, need to get cognitive done first
14/03/2024, 01:00 - Misha: I’m gonna start working tomorrow evening hopefully throughout the weekend
14/03/2024, 01:00 - Misha: Got 2 other things due in today
14/03/2024, 01:00 - EthanT: Thats cool, cognitive is due on Friday, still got a lot to do
14/03/2024, 01:24 - Nik: and solving probs quiz is tomorrow
14/03/2024, 01:25 - EthanT: very true
17/03/2024, 01:44 - EthanT: Is it possible we move the meeting on Monday, I have photo with the swim team at 12.30
17/03/2024, 10:12 - Nik: Where at
17/03/2024, 10:12 - Nik: Let’s move it, but we have to text Sergey
17/03/2024, 10:13 - EthanT: 12.30 at the sports hall
17/03/2024, 10:14 - Nik: Yeah, I guess we might have to move it back with 30 mins?
17/03/2024, 10:15 - EthanT: Most likely, maybe more if possible, last year took a while, and there's a lot more of us thus year
17/03/2024, 10:18 - Nik: I see. You can email Sergey in that case, I guess. Let’s just wait for @447452833836 @447753129330 @447985120259 to confirm they’re able to.
17/03/2024, 10:19 - Nik: Btw yesterday I did more work on the local db. I am now working on the switching mechanism that would query the local db if you are anonymous and the online db if you are logged in.
17/03/2024, 10:20 - Nik: It is a bit harder that I thought, but I am getting there. A lot of tiles had to be changed though, so definitely pull before doing work next time.
17/03/2024, 10:20 - Nik: I also saw @447452833836 commits. Good job bro.
17/03/2024, 10:32 - EthanT: Saw that yesterday as well, well done!
17/03/2024, 10:33 - EthanT: I'm doing some work today, fixing duplicate exercises and maybe adding a limit to the ai enhance feature of 3 to 5 times
17/03/2024, 11:03 - Nik: @447753129330 , you doing any work on the app this week?
17/03/2024, 11:04 - Misha: Yeah I’ll be able to
17/03/2024, 11:24 - Juan: It's fine with me
17/03/2024, 11:24 - Juan: Thanks guys 👍🏼
17/03/2024, 12:33 - Nik: GUYS, ASYA DID SOMETHING
17/03/2024, 12:33 - Nik: She didn’t tell me and just surprised me rn
17/03/2024, 12:35 - Nik: I’ll send it to you in a moment
17/03/2024, 12:35 - Nik: <Media omitted>
17/03/2024, 12:36 - Nik: She even used our colors and stuff! And she didn’t even tell me!!
17/03/2024, 12:36 - EthanT: Thats actually really good!
17/03/2024, 12:36 - Nik: ❤️
17/03/2024, 12:37 - Nik: I’ll upload it later then 💪
17/03/2024, 12:37 - Nik: Now working on the local db
17/03/2024, 12:40 - Juan: Yh really nice
17/03/2024, 17:05 - Nik: I’ve spent some few hours today working on the localDB
17/03/2024, 17:06 - Nik: I believe that the DB is fully functioning, but I am having problems to make both the local and online db behave similarly
17/03/2024, 17:06 - Nik: That’s why it is still now working in the app
17/03/2024, 17:09 - Nik: Hopefully I find some more hours to work on that tomorrow and finish it.
17/03/2024, 17:10 - EthanT: Im heading library tonight to work on polishing the workouts section
17/03/2024, 17:10 - Nik: Then that would be the last big functional thing I do before submitting.
17/03/2024, 17:10 - Nik: 💪💪💪
18/03/2024, 00:04 - EthanT: Just pushed my changes for the day
18/03/2024, 08:10 - Nik: Cool cool
18/03/2024, 08:16 - Nik: Did you ask Sergey to move the meeting btw?
18/03/2024, 10:00 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
18/03/2024, 10:57 - Nik: We can do it at 13 if you think you’ll be done with the photo for 30 mins. If not, we can do it at 13:30 and be with Sergey for 30 mins, but then continue the meeting alone if need be.
18/03/2024, 10:57 - Nik: You decide, @447514583905
18/03/2024, 10:57 - EthanT: Should be done by 1, that's cool with me
18/03/2024, 11:37 - Nik: To text Sergey?
18/03/2024, 11:40 - EthanT: Just emailed him
18/03/2024, 11:40 - Misha: That case I’ll most likely join online if it’s a 30 min meeting
18/03/2024, 11:41 - Misha: I’m currently working on my page
18/03/2024, 11:41 - Misha: Done with the session data
18/03/2024, 11:41 - EthanT: We're meeting at 13.30, sergey said he has a meeting at 13.00
18/03/2024, 11:41 - Misha: No problem
18/03/2024, 11:42 - Nik: Ok
18/03/2024, 11:52 - Juan: Cool
18/03/2024, 13:16 - Nik: I am getting ready and will head towards the Kennedy building in 4-5 mins. You done with the group photo event, @447514583905?
18/03/2024, 13:17 - Nik: Also is anyone going to be online for today?
18/03/2024, 13:17 - Misha: I am
18/03/2024, 13:17 - Manuel Montero: i was getting ready to go but my laundry didn’t dry so i had to run it again i think i’ll need to do online
18/03/2024, 13:18 - EthanT: Just left sports hall
18/03/2024, 13:22 - EthanT: Waiting in the lobby now

18/03/2024, 15:58 - Manuel Montero: <Media omitted>
18/03/2024, 15:59 - Manuel Montero: <Media omitted>
18/03/2024, 15:59 - Manuel Montero: so it’s all due 4 April
18/03/2024, 15:59 - Juan: Amazing
18/03/2024, 18:21 - Nik: We should still try and do it by the end of March
18/03/2024, 18:22 - EthanT: Oh, 100%
18/03/2024, 18:22 - Nik: But these few more days that we have just to feel safe, they are nice
18/03/2024, 18:22 - Nik: I'm opening it rn - will tty to fix the error I have on my branch
18/03/2024, 18:29 - Nik: Do you reset the tables rn, Ethan?
18/03/2024, 18:29 - Nik: <Media omitted>
18/03/2024, 18:29 - EthanT: Yee I did, I restarted them all but history
18/03/2024, 18:30 - Nik: Do I create it or are you going to do it?
18/03/2024, 18:30 - Nik: Arent you in a call with Misha rn btw? <This message was edited>
18/03/2024, 18:30 - EthanT: It's in the dB code onlien
18/03/2024, 18:30 - EthanT: I'm getting food rn
18/03/2024, 18:30 - Nik: Yeah, I know. I'll do it in a sec
18/03/2024, 18:42 - Nik: Juan, there is this History.java Class where all the code is commented out. Should I delete it or do you use it for something?
18/03/2024, 18:50 - Juan: I need to check something with it but I can delete it later today
18/03/2024, 18:57 - Nik: Great
18/03/2024, 22:16 - Nik: Guys… I want to ask you how do you think we should do workout creation in anonymous mode?
18/03/2024, 22:23 - EthanT: Search only id say
18/03/2024, 22:24 - Nik: ?
18/03/2024, 22:25 - Nik: I wanted to ask if new workouts should be added to the local workouts db
18/03/2024, 22:27 - EthanT: As in if your anomanous, you can't create or use ai
18/03/2024, 22:27 - EthanT: Anomanous can use local or online, depending if their connection
18/03/2024, 22:28 - Nik: Wait
18/03/2024, 22:28 - Nik: But that’s what I asked today
18/03/2024, 22:28 - Nik: And we decided it is only local db that’s available if you are anonymous <This message was edited>
18/03/2024, 22:29 - Nik: Because behavior and db accessing otherwise is extremely complicated and we cannot do that in the next few days
18/03/2024, 22:29 - Nik: I personally can’t
18/03/2024, 22:29 - EthanT: If its too complicated, just assume annomous is offline
18/03/2024, 22:30 - EthanT: At this point, do whatever easiest due to time
19/03/2024, 11:48 - Nik: @447514583905 , we have solving problems in 13 mins. Do you want to go to the library after that for a bit, because I want to discuss some stuff regarding how our databases work with you? <This message was edited>
19/03/2024, 11:50 - Nik: It is because I’ve spent a few hours on the online and local db after yesterday and I’ve reached a point where to continue working on the local db we have to decide what we want it to do.
19/03/2024, 11:51 - EthanT: Sounds good, I was going to the library instead of the lecture to discuss the active workout page, with misha but I haven't had a response
20/03/2024, 13:54 - Misha: Anyone already at the library?
20/03/2024, 13:57 - Nik: I am geating ready rn
20/03/2024, 13:57 - Nik: should be there in around 10 minutes
20/03/2024, 13:57 - Nik: @447753129330 @447452833836 @447514583905 you on your way guys?
20/03/2024, 13:57 - Juan: Yes
20/03/2024, 13:58 - Manuel Montero: yes just finished a lecture
20/03/2024, 14:00 - EthanT: Finishing some tests
20/03/2024, 14:01 - Misha: I’m outside the library main entrance
20/03/2024, 14:01 - Misha: Weather is so nice I reckon we sit outside haha
20/03/2024, 14:01 - Manuel Montero: yes 😭
20/03/2024, 14:01 - Misha: <Media omitted>
20/03/2024, 14:05 - Nik: It’s actually amazing
20/03/2024, 14:05 - Nik: But what about charging laptops?
20/03/2024, 14:07 - EthanT: omw
20/03/2024, 14:09 - Misha: I brought a solar panel
20/03/2024, 14:09 - Misha: Nah but if we need to charge we’ll just go inside
20/03/2024, 14:09 - Nik: I’ll need right off the bat basically
20/03/2024, 14:10 - Nik: Mine is less than 50%
20/03/2024, 14:10 - Misha: Yeah nws we’ll just go inside for now
20/03/2024, 14:10 - EthanT: Just thrown some commits to main as a heads up
20/03/2024, 14:15 - Nik: We are in front of the library with the boys, @447514583905
20/03/2024, 14:17 - Manuel Montero: same spot?
20/03/2024, 14:21 - Misha: Yeah
20/03/2024, 14:26 - EthanT: 2d @447753129330
20/03/2024, 14:26 - Manuel Montero: going
20/03/2024, 14:26 - Manuel Montero: im in g floor
20/03/2024, 15:50 - Manuel Montero: mamonme4@gmail.com
20/03/2024, 16:12 - Nik: All (except for Manu), please send me your gmails
20/03/2024, 16:12 - Misha: koroliov1985@gmail.com
20/03/2024, 16:13 - Nik: I just shared you with you, @447753129330 and @447985120259
20/03/2024, 16:13 - EthanT: teatherethan@gmail.com
20/03/2024, 16:13 - Nik: Only Juan's left now
20/03/2024, 16:49 - Nik: I created the skeleton of the technical report btw.
20/03/2024, 16:49 - Nik: I will leave it like that for now and will try to fix the final sql syntax errors for the local db.
20/03/2024, 17:02 - Juan: juandasa74@gmail.com
20/03/2024, 17:03 - Nik: Ty, everyone must have it now
20/03/2024, 17:04 - Nik: I've added a few points to some of the sections. I'll send a screenshot and explain how I've formatted it
20/03/2024, 17:04 - Nik: <Media omitted>
20/03/2024, 17:07 - Nik: Basically
- each section is on a new page (separated with page breaks)
- the title of the page is set to style = Heading 1
- immediately below the content of the section is described
- that's followed by a blank line, a horizontal line, and another blank line
- below that I write the outline that we talked about at the end of our meeting today

That's it :)
20/03/2024, 17:14 - Nik: I may have spent an unnecessary amount of time on the title page, but at least it looks beautiful imo
20/03/2024, 17:14 - Nik: <Media omitted>
22/03/2024, 19:50 - Nik: Guys, when were we meeting tomorrow?
22/03/2024, 20:40 - EthanT: Im not bothered, im good for when everyone else is
22/03/2024, 20:42 - Nik: Pretty much same
22/03/2024, 20:45 - Misha: Oh guys sorry forgot to message, I have to be at my thing at 12:45 and it’s a pretty tight morning schedule for me
22/03/2024, 20:45 - Misha: I can come for 30 min ~ or something or if it’s ok with you guys I just join you on a call
22/03/2024, 20:45 - Misha: Will still be there
22/03/2024, 21:37 - Juan: I can do any time either tomorrow or Sunday
22/03/2024, 23:28 - Nik: Manu?
22/03/2024, 23:28 - Nik: What if we do it early, Misha
22/03/2024, 23:28 - Manuel Montero: I can’t do in the morning, but I can meet anytime after like 1pm
22/03/2024, 23:29 - Nik: Has anyone worked on the report btw?
22/03/2024, 23:42 - Nik: Why not it the morning? I am asking, because I think Misha can only do morning. If not, we can think of something after misha’s match
22/03/2024, 23:42 - Manuel Montero: I have an appointment at 10 am 😔
22/03/2024, 23:42 - EthanT: I havent added anything but ive started some ideas
22/03/2024, 23:42 - Manuel Montero: like a therapy appointment
22/03/2024, 23:43 - Manuel Montero: it’s online but I need to be in a quiet space where i can talk freely and stuff
22/03/2024, 23:43 - Nik: I see. How long do you think it will take? 1hr?
22/03/2024, 23:43 - Manuel Montero: It’s usually 1h 30m
22/03/2024, 23:46 - Nik: Hmm, then we can meet early with Misha. Then he might leave for his match, but you can substitute him. I imagine that we meet with Misha in person at 11, but then after he leaves at around 12, you might join, Manu. I hope that by 13 or 14 we are going to have done a substantial amount of work.
22/03/2024, 23:46 - Nik: @447985120259 , are you going to be able to do that? I am asking for in person though, not online. <This message was edited>
23/03/2024, 00:03 - Misha: So tomorrow are we going to be writing out the things we did as bullet points onto the report? If so I can contribute by also writing what I did and also put the bullet points into a readable format as this is Nik and I’s job, I can do all of that on Saturday after my match. 

Me and one of my other teammates are practising outside campus and then going back to campus after that, hence it’s a very busy morning, I can assure that I’ll get my part done on Saturday, also by looking at what you guys did during the day will help me do my part,even by myself.
23/03/2024, 00:08 - Nik: I understand, but I don’t know how well that’s going to work. Anyway, I guess we cannot do anything about that. Maybe you can speak with someone later and they can explain to you what’s been discussed, idk
23/03/2024, 00:08 - Nik: In that case I suggest Manu tell us when he is free the earliest (12 hopefully) and we meet then, without Misha.
23/03/2024, 00:12 - Misha: Yeah this is my last competition for uni so no more after that it’s annoying as it cannot be moved… I will definitely speak with someone so I know what to do
23/03/2024, 00:24 - EthanT: I'm good for most of tomorrow so i can knock out a lot of the report. But Sunday, I'm going Dover insanely early, so I need to sleep early for that 😭
23/03/2024, 00:24 - EthanT: I'll get some work done down there if I get time
23/03/2024, 01:06 - Nik: So we meet tomorrow at 12 @447753129330 @447452833836 ?
23/03/2024, 01:07 - Manuel Montero: I’ll try to be ready for 12.
23/03/2024, 10:03 - Juan: Yh I'll be there
23/03/2024, 10:59 - Manuel Montero: i might be a bit late as the session started a bit later, about half an hour
23/03/2024, 11:09 - EthanT: I'm grabbing some food, should still be there on time
23/03/2024, 11:26 - Juan: I'm grabbing some food as well but I might arrive a few mins late
23/03/2024, 11:53 - Nik: I am getting ready rn
23/03/2024, 12:03 - Nik: I am almost there
23/03/2024, 12:04 - Nik: Where are you all at?
23/03/2024, 12:05 - EthanT: Finish a coffee off
23/03/2024, 12:11 - Nik: D block?
23/03/2024, 12:13 - Nik: Guys
23/03/2024, 12:13 - Nik: With Asya we are at group study room 8
23/03/2024, 12:13 - Nik: D block
23/03/2024, 12:13 - Nik: Ground floor
23/03/2024, 12:17 - Nik: It booked, but there is no one here
23/03/2024, 12:17 - Nik: So until the come, it is free
23/03/2024, 12:18 - EthanT: Im grabbing my stuff now
23/03/2024, 12:26 - EthanT: Omw
23/03/2024, 12:28 - Juan: I'm with Nikola at the library
23/03/2024, 12:28 - Juan: When are you guys arriving?
23/03/2024, 12:29 - Manuel Montero: im on my way
23/03/2024, 12:53 - EthanT: <Media omitted>
23/03/2024, 13:04 - Manuel Montero: According to the LATEX document, the referencing guidelines used by CEMS is Harvard, so if at any point do we need to either quote, paraphrase or refer to any outside publication, documentation or guidelines, we need to use Harvard in-line. It also applies for the Bibliography.
23/03/2024, 17:31 - Misha: Hey guys, how did your meeting go
23/03/2024, 17:31 - Misha: I just finished
24/03/2024, 15:51 - Nik: It went well
24/03/2024, 15:51 - Nik: With Ethan we are at the library rn to do some more work on the report
25/03/2024, 10:32 - Nik: Hey, all
25/03/2024, 10:32 - Nik: Don’t forget about our meeting with Sergey today
25/03/2024, 10:33 - Nik: It is either our last or second to last
25/03/2024, 10:42 - Misha: Hey guys, I’ll have to join online this one again, my girlfriend is very sick and we just came from the medical centre so I’ll be looking after her.

I’m working on the my part in the technical report as well as refining the code.
25/03/2024, 11:00 - EthanT: I'll be at the meeting but slightly late, only woke up not long ago and need to get food
25/03/2024, 11:05 - Nik: I would suggest focusing more on the technical report and less on the code then.
25/03/2024, 11:05 - Nik: Ok, I should be there on time.

@447452833836 , @447753129330 ?
25/03/2024, 11:09 - Manuel Montero: ill be there
25/03/2024, 11:19 - Juan: Same
25/03/2024, 11:36 - Misha: Hey guys, I have to leave for hospital urgently as my girlfriend is in a bad condition and Iwill have to MIA for a few hours, I will do significant work on the report when we hopefully get back , sorry for the inconvenience again guys
25/03/2024, 11:37 - Manuel Montero: I’m sorry for your girlfriend I hope she recovers okay 😔
25/03/2024, 11:37 - EthanT: All good thanks for letting us know. Hope all will be good 🙏
25/03/2024, 11:46 - Juan: Sorry to hear that, hope she recovers soon
25/03/2024, 11:47 - Juan: I'm arriving 5 or 10 mins late
25/03/2024, 11:47 - EthanT: I'm about to leave
25/03/2024, 11:48 - Nik: Sorry to hear that, hope she gets better soon.
25/03/2024, 20:53 - Nik: I am currently adding some color to some of the icons btw
25/03/2024, 20:53 - Nik: <Media omitted>
25/03/2024, 20:54 - EthanT: Looks perfect
25/03/2024, 20:55 - EthanT: I've got the ai finished, I'll push when I'm back from swim
25/03/2024, 21:40 - Nik: Nicee
25/03/2024, 21:41 - Nik: I added some more color. It even got to the point where it was too colorful, so I removed some.
25/03/2024, 22:42 - Nik: <Media omitted>
25/03/2024, 22:42 - Nik: I made the border colorful as well, but I removed it afterwards. Was getting too colorful
25/03/2024, 23:59 - EthanT: Just pushed additions to the AI, will be working on the AI daily though to continue improving it
26/03/2024, 15:48 - EthanT: Added some more sections to the technical report: one testing section outline the format of tests and how we did it, and the other outlining what information we gathered during testing and how we resolved any issues
26/03/2024, 22:04 - Nik: Amazing work
26/03/2024, 22:04 - Nik: I also see improvement to the app
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: Great
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: Only issue is that AI doesn’t work
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: It somehow broke
26/03/2024, 22:05 - EthanT: Which one
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: I tried to create workout and enhance it and it broke both times
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: Both of them
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: I’ve got 3/3 crashes
26/03/2024, 22:05 - Nik: It is not even 50%
26/03/2024, 22:06 - EthanT: Oh, enhance I know is broken, generating one im adding the "unsure" mechanic, but its hard to get it to failt to generate a workout, and it doenst give a consistent error message currently
26/03/2024, 22:06 - EthanT: Create one should work, give me a sec to check
26/03/2024, 22:07 - Nik: I just did it again
26/03/2024, 22:07 - Nik: It wokred
26/03/2024, 22:07 - Nik: I think issue was I didn’t provide enough info…
26/03/2024, 22:08 - EthanT: Perhaps, it should Toast a message when it fails, but it doenst give the same output when theres not enough info, even through I told it to in the prompt
26/03/2024, 22:14 - Nik: Dw about it
26/03/2024, 22:14 - Nik: It works most times
26/03/2024, 22:14 - Nik: Tomorrow we’ll look at it again
26/03/2024, 22:19 - EthanT: Im done with the report for tonight so ill have a quick look
26/03/2024, 23:19 - EthanT: Just adding the latest version of the AI. Generating should work consistently. Enhance seems to but definitely needs improvement, such as giving the JSON format of the data it needs
27/03/2024, 01:14 - Nik: 💪💪💪
27/03/2024, 12:33 - Nik: We are meeting today at 13 as we discussed during the Monday meeting, right
27/03/2024, 12:33 - Nik: I hope no one’s forgot that
27/03/2024, 12:34 - Manuel Montero: I didn’t forget but I’ll be there a bit late, I gotta talk to Student Welfare about my ILP for exams
27/03/2024, 12:35 - Nik: Ok, we can move it to 13:30, if you that suits you better
27/03/2024, 12:35 - Nik: Or just start without you and then you join us later
27/03/2024, 12:36 - Manuel Montero: start and I’ll join you it’s not far from library x
27/03/2024, 12:44 - Juan: Oh no i forgot 😯
27/03/2024, 12:44 - Juan: I can make it by 1:30 - 1:40
27/03/2024, 12:59 - Nik: That’s ok
27/03/2024, 13:17 - Nik: I am grabbing a coffee from Nero rn and I’ll be at the library.
27/03/2024, 13:17 - Nik: You there, @447514583905 ?
27/03/2024, 13:17 - EthanT: Indeed
27/03/2024, 13:18 - Nik: See you in 5’ then
27/03/2024, 13:23 - Nik: They had some queue
27/03/2024, 13:23 - Nik: But it shouldn’t take much longer
27/03/2024, 14:03 - Juan: Where are you guys?
27/03/2024, 14:04 - EthanT: Mid 1st floor
27/03/2024, 14:09 - Juan: Ok
29/03/2024, 12:15 - EthanT: Im heading to the library in a few hours if anyone wants to join
29/03/2024, 21:30 - Nik: I was at the library the entire day
29/03/2024, 21:30 - Nik: I didn't see your message though
29/03/2024, 21:30 - Nik: I'll be there tomorrow as well, so we can work together if you are going to be there
29/03/2024, 21:30 - Nik: Anyone, actually
29/03/2024, 21:30 - EthanT: Sounds good
29/03/2024, 21:30 - EthanT: I've done mainly coding today
29/03/2024, 21:31 - Nik: Btw I am creating new document rn. I renamed the last one to COMP6000 Technical Report - Outline and this one I am just calling COMP6000 Technical Report. The idea is to put just the finished sections in the actual report.
29/03/2024, 21:31 - Nik: Any progress?
29/03/2024, 21:39 - EthanT: Looking into making steps stored locally, need to continue work but the basics is on main
29/03/2024, 21:39 - EthanT: Also made the stats grey till they load
29/03/2024, 21:40 - EthanT: Expereminting with notifications as well <This message was edited>
29/03/2024, 23:26 - Nik: Sounds great 👍
29/03/2024, 23:26 - Nik: Interesting
29/03/2024, 23:27 - EthanT: It'll only be basic things,like saying everyone hour to suggest to do a workout
29/03/2024, 23:27 - EthanT: I'll play around with it when I get back tonight
30/03/2024, 16:31 - Nik: I am at the library rn. Will be working on the report.
30/03/2024, 16:32 - EthanT: Eating rn, I may be at the library later, but I'll be doing the report as well regardless
30/03/2024, 17:30 - Nik: I just converted the optimizations plan into paragraphs
30/03/2024, 17:31 - Nik: I am going to work on a plan for the ChatGptClient Java class rn and then convert that to paragraphs as well.
30/03/2024, 17:31 - EthanT: Ill get the databse section done today
30/03/2024, 17:32 - Nik: Great, let me know when you are done with that. I may start working on the conclusion section after that.
30/03/2024, 17:32 - EthanT: Yee, conclusion section is the only one we haven't started yet, and theres a lot to do there
30/03/2024, 18:36 - Juan: I'm gonna eat and start working on the report as well
30/03/2024, 18:37 - Nik: Nice
30/03/2024, 18:43 - Nik: I am doing the Workflow section rn. It would include screenshots from the app, so I created a folder in the Documents directory to store them. Also did some minor coding. Just pushed to main.
30/03/2024, 19:37 - EthanT: First draft of Database overview is done
30/03/2024, 19:55 - Nik: Nice. I am still working on the Workflow. I've documented a fair bit of the process in screenshots. Just pushed them to main.
30/03/2024, 20:02 - Nik: Btw enhance doesn't work for some reason. It doesn't crash, but it doesn't work either.
30/03/2024, 20:03 - EthanT: Ill pull from main and check
30/03/2024, 20:12 - Nik: Workflow is done, but it is 1100 words, so now I am going to try and condense it to 600-700 words.
30/03/2024, 20:12 - Nik: I may go back home and eat something first though.
30/03/2024, 20:20 - EthanT: I'll check enhance, as well as get the step counter and notifications working by Sunday latest
31/03/2024, 00:38 - EthanT: Finished step counter
31/03/2024, 10:13 - Nik: Cool
31/03/2024, 17:42 - EthanT: Done done some permission fixing with the step coutner, also added a background color to the navigation bar, not sure on the color tho, someone can play around with that
31/03/2024, 19:45 - Nik: I’ll pull rn and check it out
31/03/2024, 23:27 - Nik: Reduced it to 550 which is good imo
31/03/2024, 23:27 - Nik: I am going to do the ChatGptClient Class Section rn
31/03/2024, 23:50 - Nik: Just before that wrote a short 200 words on the "Tools" section. I believe that this is enough for it.
31/03/2024, 23:50 - Nik: Now doing that. Then witll check "Conclusions" out.
31/03/2024, 23:51 - EthanT: Im planning on doing some of that tomorrow
31/03/2024, 23:54 - Nik: There will probably be a lot left. I will try to write some, but it really depends on how long I can keep myself awake. Still, I will try to help us out for tomorrow, haha
01/04/2024, 00:36 - Nik: How many words was the report supposed to be, because as of rn we have around 4500
01/04/2024, 00:36 - EthanT: 6000
01/04/2024, 01:00 - Nik: Good
01/04/2024, 01:00 - Nik: Btw I expanded the Conclusions outline quite a bit.
01/04/2024, 01:01 - Nik: I am working on the paragraphs rn
01/04/2024, 01:05 - EthanT: Ill look into the conclusions tomorrow as well, too late to now 😅
01/04/2024, 02:18 - Nik: I wrote some stuff down, but I’ll revise them and add them to the doc tomorrow.
01/04/2024, 02:20 - Nik: Tomorrow morning I will work on job related stuff until the meeting with Sergey, then we meet with him, and then I’ll focus on COMP6000. Today I was talking with Ethan that we can focus on the video tomorrow. I was thinking that we could do that after the meeting with Sergey.
01/04/2024, 11:06 - Nik: Guys… I just realized that I have an assignment… DUE TODAY
01/04/2024, 11:07 - Nik: I am probably going to focus on that today
01/04/2024, 11:07 - Nik: Do you know if we are having a meeting with Sergey, what did he say last week?
01/04/2024, 11:08 - Manuel Montero: I think he’s probably at home since it’s a bank holiday today too
01/04/2024, 11:08 - Nik: I would guess, but then he might have said that he’ll be working
01/04/2024, 11:09 - Nik: I honestly don’t remember if we talked about today
01/04/2024, 11:09 - Nik: Anyway, I think I will have tos kip doe to the robotics assignment that I realized about just now
01/04/2024, 11:10 - EthanT: I can go see if he's there if need be, fill him in that we're doing final tests and finishing the report and video
01/04/2024, 11:58 - EthanT: Kennedy isn't even open
I'll email Sergey in a moment
01/04/2024, 12:13 - Nik: Damn
01/04/2024, 13:57 - EthanT: Just done a few minor commit.

Enhance now works, the prompt was ok 2 lines, gpt doenst like this.

I've also got a bug I noticed this morning with delete account fixed. Whilst it dated the user, it would delete history's with the email attached, that's fixed too
01/04/2024, 14:03 - EthanT: Im now adding buttons to history to redo a previously done exercise
01/04/2024, 18:17 - Nik: Good job, bro
01/04/2024, 18:17 - Nik: And I just submitted
01/04/2024, 18:17 - Nik: I’ll take a little break and check the report out
01/04/2024, 18:17 - Nik: Will work on conclusions
01/04/2024, 18:17 - EthanT: 🥳
01/04/2024, 18:18 - Nik: Yeah, it was so stressful when this morning I realized that it’s due today
01/04/2024, 18:46 - Misha: Hey guys I am in London for Easter at the moment so was away for most of the day, will work on the report till the 4th
01/04/2024, 22:55 - Nik: I am still revising robotics material, so I've not gotten to that. Definitelly will do it tomorrow though. I am also down for doing part of the recording tomorrow. I have lectures until 13 after which I will eat something and maybe chill for an hour, so if Ethan is ok, we can meet to start recording after that.
01/04/2024, 22:56 - Nik: ok
01/04/2024, 23:01 - EthanT: Sounds good to me
02/04/2024, 11:11 - Nik: Btw change of plans for me, so I am good right after the data and text lectuer. Actually, I am good to even leave the lecture early. I can get the code and stay for 10 minutes, if need be. So Ethan decides what time suits him, since the video recording is at his.
02/04/2024, 11:12 - Nik: Just let us know when it is best for you, bro
02/04/2024, 11:14 - EthanT: I'm back in gulbenkian, it won't take me long to clean when I get back
02/04/2024, 12:12 - Nik: I see. Text me if you are ready early and can have me
02/04/2024, 12:12 - Nik: I am ok to leave at any point from now
02/04/2024, 12:58 - Juan: Are we meeting at the library?
02/04/2024, 12:59 - Nik: Just finished the lecture. I’ll need a few minutes though.
02/04/2024, 12:59 - Nik: Ethan can say
02/04/2024, 12:59 - EthanT: Depends partially on what we're recoridn on. If its just mobile, we can do it in the library, but we'd need to find someplace qiet
02/04/2024, 13:00 - EthanT: Otherwise, im finishing cleaning my room now, we can do it there
02/04/2024, 13:01 - Manuel Montero: I’m comig back to Canterbury now the train is a bit delayed 😭
02/04/2024, 13:02 - Misha: I’m available to call if need be, won’t make it from London in time unfortunately 😢
02/04/2024, 13:06 - Juan: Ok up to you man
02/04/2024, 13:07 - Juan: If we wanted to do library maybe we could book a study room
02/04/2024, 13:07 - EthanT: Ive finished tyding so im good for wherever
02/04/2024, 13:16 - Nik: I had something important to do, but I am free now
02/04/2024, 13:16 - Nik: I am in front of the library, but I think it will be better to record at yours
02/04/2024, 13:16 - Nik: Because it is quitet
02/04/2024, 13:16 - Nik: R
02/04/2024, 13:16 - Nik: But it is your say
02/04/2024, 13:17 - EthanT: Im cool with doing it at mine
02/04/2024, 13:17 - Juan: I'm gonna get ready and leave the house so I should be there by 2
02/04/2024, 13:18 - Nik: I’ll head there in a 5 minutes then. Should be there by 13:30. Same place as last year, right?
02/04/2024, 13:18 - EthanT: Different one, 226
02/04/2024, 13:18 - EthanT: lmk when your outside
02/04/2024, 13:18 - Nik: Ok
02/04/2024, 14:08 - Juan: I'm on campus
